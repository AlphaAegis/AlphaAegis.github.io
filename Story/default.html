  <h1>Story</h1>
  
  <h2> Act 1 </h2>
  <div class="container">
  <p class="center">You find yourself standing in front of your trusted fixer, Ron Elbert, at the Nut Farm bar’s top floor office. Ron Leads the Night Blood gang and gives you and your friends odd jobs every once in a while. Pay is good, risk is manageable, and Ron isn't the worst person to work with. Ron is a ginger (gross) man, semi cut, with a cybernetic arm and a shotgun on his hip. Usually dresses in business attire, Ron likes to call himself a business man, but we both know what he really is. He is usually straight, to the point, and very serious.
  
Ron, sitting at his desk, tells the players, “Boys do I have the perfect gig for you… Context, the Mafia has set up shop a little too close to home, so I need to show those old timey gonks who owns this place. There is a warehouse on the other side of the corpo center, [LOOK UP ADDRESS]. Ima need you guys to repossess some of the assets in that warehouse and bring it here. I Don’t exactly care how you acquire the goods, just grab all you can and burn the rest. Bring it back here, just around back. Pay is double the usual, 1k each, more depending on how much of the stuff you grab.”Naturally burning drugs is a terrible idea, so we will see what the players do here…

>>Players are free here to spend any excess money, or do extra things like GET A CAR.

Upon arriving at the warehouse, players will find two men in suits and fedoras outside with no visible cyberware. They are open carrying tommy guns with drum mags, 1920’s style (Chicago Goon). Both speak in a chicago accent, and will gladly light up the players if angered. Wearing no armor, so easily killable. Inside there are about 10 more guards, wearing the same clothing (same goon) and 3 specialist goons (Chicago Specialist).

>>Here will need to improvise based on player’s actions, whether stealthy or just walking in. </p>

<h3>Inside the warehouse</h3>
<a href="warehouse.png">
 <img src="warehouse.png"  style="width:300px" class="center"/>
</a>
<p class="center"> players will find pallets of drugs, so many that it would be impossible to fit it all in 1 car. If counted, there are 29 pallets of Tarogen and 1 pallet of misc drugs like hypo and synthcoke. If players know, 1 box of Tarogen is more valuable than the entire pallet of misc drugs. Each pallet has 8 boxes of drugs wrapped up. Each box has 30 doses of each. 

>>Players CAN leave and come back with a box truck or something, but by the time they get back, majority of the product will be gone (4 Pallets of Tarogen and the misc drug pallet left) and there will be even more guards there now. 5 cops, 10 Chicago Goons, 8 Chicago Specialists, and 1 Chicago MiniBoss. Currently loading the rest of the product into a truck themselves, so bringing one would have been useless unless thought of ahead of time.

So players get drugs to Nut Farm. Ron will pay 100 to each player per box, so if 1 pallet = 800 per player. He will pay not very much for the misc drugs. Once players bring the goods, however they can, Ron greets them with 2 bodyguards. These guys look built for close quarters engagements, shotguns, blades, the whole works. Once players give the money up, Ron will get one of his guys to drop the bag of money, classic exchange, done it before. Ron goes, “see you guys for the next one…” and him and his guys walk back into the nut farm with the goods.
Players now free to go around and do what they please until the next job (hint that something might happen here so can't end session)

>>After a bit, jump them with Chicago Specialists, its time to introduce the boss…

Bagged and incapacitated, players are brought to the Night City Bay (they dont know this). They noticed things being wrapped to their feet and their restraints. They are walked to a spot and once they are all in place, the bags on their heads are lifted. Upon the bag being lifted, they are blinded with car lights shining on them, they slowly notice that there are a lot of goons here and they are at the docks, backs facing the water. All players and Ron and 2 bodyguards from Ron’s place are here. One man starts to walk forward, and says,
“So, you boys thought you could just steal from me and kill my men right under my nose huh? Well you thought wrong. I think its time you meet the rest of my enemies.”
He waves at one of his goons, this one is decked out in cyberware.  The mini boss goon goes to rons body guards and pushes them into the water, once he gets to Ron, Ron says,
“You won’t get away with this, the night bloods are going to have your head you know…”
Man responds with, “eh, ive dealt with worse before.” and the mini boss pushes ron into the water. The mini boss gets to the players and the man says,
“Wait. You boys did a bang up job on my place, if all of you equal all of the goons you killed, then maybe you can be useful. Choice is yours…”
If a player says no, they are pushed into the water and die, assuming other players agree, they are cut loose and introduced to the man.
“The name’s Al, Al Capone. Welcome to the Mafia.” 
He walks away, saying, 
“Meet me at this location for your next job, you got 24 hours to get straight.” 
As he is saying this, the miniboss hands players a piece of paper with an address on it, and then walks away too.

As players are leaving the docks, a bright flash of light and boom happens on the same empty street as them, and a minivan comes soaring by, and stopping nearly in front of them. Players hear some mumblings in the car, indistinct, and a man steps out. He looks relatively older, blonde long hair, labcoat and shirtless underneath. In a surfer voice he laughs, 
“HAHAHA, I can’t believe it worked brah!”
He looks at players,
“I just like-” BANG
The mans head explodes right in front of the players, and players look towards where the shot came from. It was Al Capone right next to his own car. He shouts, “Just saved ya life again boys, better be grateful. Consider that minivan a sign on bonus.” 
Him and his goons speed away, as the players are left with a dead corpse in front of them, and a slightly bloody purple minivan. Upon closer inspection, it looks heavily modded, and seats 8 people. It is still smoking from the flash and bang it just came from. If players get in, an AI greets them [Play voice clip here].

  <h2> Act 2 </h2>
  <div class="container">
  <p class="center"> Upon the start, inform players of what Mike looked like, and that Kiriko and Danny's foster parent friend Nate are there. Kiriko will ask Nate, "Why are you here? I get that Cass got mixed in with some bad group again but what are you doing here?"
  Nate will reply with, "I know this guy, so I guess thats why I'm here.", Kiriko will look at Cass and say, "Oh I havn't introduced him to you yet, this is my other boyfriend Nate." Upon analyzing Nate, he is unbelievable buff, and sort of recognizable as a media.

>>Kiriko here can converse with the car if players choose not to
>>Players here can converse with the car, use the preset soundboard, but dont introduce the borg bot idea until later

>>At this point, players can choose to time travel (maybe use a sound that does not promote time travel unless the players know when, where, and why they should)

>>Players can wait until meeting time, or continue where they left off last session in their free time. Proceed when players head to meeting spot with Al

The address on the paper, funnily enough, points back to the Nut Farm. Upon arriving, players will notice Chicago goons outside the bar, and inside the bar, they don't serve alcohol, or at least publicly. Players will need to head to the back, the same office where Ron was to meet Al.
>>If players are thinking of jumping and killing Al here, show how its suicide with multiple Chicago Mini Bosses and specialists.

Upon entering the office, Al will say “Ah, looks like you boys chose the right option. I’ve got some great jobs lined up for you. There's this convoy from Brah Corp headed through our area, Ima need you fellas to liberate the contents in said convoy. I’ve got no idea what is inside there, all I knows is I want it.” He hands a shard over to the players with details on when and where the convoy is headed. There is also details of what the convoy consists of, 2 trucks, and 2 humvees, so 6 goons (use random goon generator) but all dressed in suits. (all have SMG 21 (3D6, 2/3/15, 30) or random pistol) One Humvee has a .50 on top.
>>Players can choose where to take the convoy and how. If players mess it up, they always have a time machine, but should not use it to meet themselves. If they do, introduce some villain from a different time or something. CANT ACTUALLY USE TIME MACHINE unless power core…

Inside convoys, One has weapons, one has drugs. One pallet of Tarogen, and other misc drugs inside, there is also a round device inside that is in a very protective box (power core). The weapon truck has 1 crate of H&K G38’s (10), no ammo, but one big metal box in the back. Upon opening, players see a very large gun with a huge mag on the side. The gun is very heavy and anyone attempting to shoot it will most likely dislocate their shoulder. Upon inspection, this gun fires a custom 20mm round, and the mag only has 10 rounds in it. It looks like a massive sniper rifle.

>>Naturally, all of the contents of these trucks should be brought to Al, hiding some of it might result in punishments… 

As players leave, if they don't discover a tracking device on the vehicles, they will be pursued by goons on bikes (4).

>>Snarky AI comment, “well that was surprisingly convenient.”

Players bring back goods to the nut farm, in or out trucks. If they bring the convoys trucks to the nut farm, then Al will be upset, “you really thought bringing a tracked vehicle to my place of business was a good idea?” Then will burn down nut farm.
Either way, new location for doing business.
Al will pay them each 1k for the job, no extra, will not budge. Players free from here to kill time before next job.

[END SCENE]

Next mission should be to eliminate HVT marked by Al, but wait until sesh 1 to see what players do from here.</p>
