  <h1>Story</h1>
  
  <h2> Act 1 </h2>
  <div class="container">
  <p>You find yourself standing in front of your trusted fixer, Ron Elbert, at the Nut Farm bar’s top floor office. Ron Leads the Night Blood gang and gives you and your friends odd jobs every once in a while. Pay is good, risk is manageable, and Ron isn't the worst person to work with. Ron is a ginger (gross) man, semi cut, with a cybernetic arm and a shotgun on his hip. Usually dresses in business attire, Ron likes to call himself a business man, but we both know what he really is. He is usually straight, to the point, and very serious.
  
Ron, sitting at his desk, tells the players, “Boys do I have the perfect gig for you… Context, the Mafia has set up shop a little too close to home, so I need to show those old timey gonks who owns this place. There is a warehouse on the other side of the corpo center, [LOOK UP ADDRESS]. Ima need you guys to repossess some of the assets in that warehouse and bring it here. I Don’t exactly care how you acquire the goods, just grab all you can and burn the rest. Pay is double the usual, 1k each, more depending on how much of the stuff you grab.”Naturally burning drugs is a terrible idea, so we will see what the players do here…

>>Players are free here to spend any excess money, or do extra things like GET A CAR.

Upon arriving at the warehouse, players will find two men in suits and fedoras outside with no visible cyberware. They are open carrying tommy guns with drum mags, 1920’s style (Chicago Goon). Both speak in a chicago accent, and will gladly light up the players if angered. Wearing no armor, so easily killable. Inside there are about 10 more guards, wearing the same clothing (same goon) and 3 specialist goons (Chicago Specialist).

>>Here will need to improvise based on player’s actions, whether stealthy or just walking in. </p>

<h3>Inside the warehouse</h3>

</a>
<p> players will find pallets of drugs, so many that it would be impossible to fit it all in 1 car. If counted, there are 29 pallets of Tarogen and 1 pallet of misc drugs like hypo and synthcoke. If players know, 1 box of Tarogen is more valuable than the entire pallet of misc drugs. Each pallet has 8 boxes of drugs wrapped up. Each box has 30 doses of each. 

>>Players CAN leave and come back with a box truck or something, but by the time they get back, majority of the product will be gone (4 Pallets of Tarogen and the misc drug pallet left) and there will be even more guards there now. 5 cops, 10 Chicago Goons, 8 Chicago Specialists, and 1 Chicago MiniBoss. Currently loading the rest of the product into a truck themselves, so bringing one would have been useless unless thought of ahead of time.

>>Pretty straight foreward from here, bring drug to ron, ron pay money, get glimpse at ron goons, let players free with money to their name.

>>After a bit, jump them with Chicago Specialists, its time to introduce the boss…
