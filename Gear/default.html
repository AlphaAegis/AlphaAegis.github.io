  <img src="lasr.png" style="width:300px" class="center">
  <div class="container">
  <p class="center">Developed by Lucas Barellio, this futuristic rifile was lost to time after the demise of <i>Rebirth</i>. This weapon uses electricity through
batteries to condense energy into a bolt and propel it towards the target. Since it is a bolt of energy, this weapon is great at penetrating objects/armor. (so half SP, but normal damage through)

  <div class="container">
  <p class="center">A sword as old as time, the infinity blade is a powerful sword that has the ability to steal the lifeforce of its victims. If the victim is super abled, it will steal this and store the ability inside the blade. The wielder of the blade has these abilities and an extended lifespan.
  If one were to live for 500 years with the blade, they would start to age at an increased rate when they do not have the blade, and result in death within 2 hours.
  Upon its wielders death, or the attunement with a new wielder, the sword will lose 1 power at random, attunement can take 1 hour to 1 week depending on the amount of powers (starts here at 1.5 hours).
