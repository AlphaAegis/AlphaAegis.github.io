  <h2> [BACKGROUND] </h2>
  <div class="container">
  <p>Continuity, been 4 years after night city got nuked by richard (unknown party). Gary and crew went into hiding never to be seen again (they exist, see [OLD CHARACTERS]) All metahumans have faded out of the public light and the rebuilding of Night City is almost done. However one man has made a machine capable of time travel [delorean ish]. He travels back in time and changes a lot of things:
1. Saves Franz Ferdinand’s life
2. Became a senator in ancient rome and saved caesars life. 
3. Kills hitler in 1943
4. Becomes sheriff in yellowstone in 1866, kills FDR’s ancestor here
5. Becomes mega rich through gambling and sports betting
Naturally this causes many things to change and time to break a bit. 
- Al Capone and others displaced into night city
- Italy is now Rome, and a bit bigger than normal, threatening nuclear war with US 
- Everything Hitler becomes Himmler
- WW1 still happened, but austria hungary still austria hungary in present, makes something not exist anymore
- WW2 stunted on both sides, US was not as economically sound and had significantly less impact in WW2, and Nazi’s crippled without Hitler. War ends in 1942, and many german innovations along with american inventions were created much later. (AV cars slow, unreliable, will blow up, very cutting edge). Japanese Empire still exists to this day, Japanese/Asian people seen as villains too…
- New corp emerging called “Brah Corp” built entirely out of gambling winnings

Players immune to effect because of a latent meta gene after the Resurrection. After all the changes, he comes back to the present to witness his changes, when he is shot the instant he leaves his car. “Who is this man?” you might be asking, well he is a man of many names…
Ancient Rome: Maximus Fortunas 
1866: Mike Felsing
1914: Max Fritz
1943: Matthew Fitzgerald
Present day (2024): Mike Felsing

Order in which times he went to these places are not mentioned anywhere, but he went in the order of:
Present → 1866 → 1943 → 1914 → 44 BC → 2018 → 2019 → 2020 → present day

Mike time jumps in with the time minivan, dies seems older, but then players later see mike on TV, younger. Time machine shows when he jumped to, not when he jumped from.

  <h2> [STORY GUIDE] </h2>
  <div class="container">
  <p>To stop the timeline from being messed up anymore players need to correct these events whether it be chronological or not. Basically a mini boss in each timeline, and players should try to correct events with era appropriate attire/weapons (some consequences if they don’t, depends on what they do)
Miniboss list:

Present: Al Capone, drug smuggler and new boss of Night City’s underground
1866: Aether Nova, Solo from 2179, born to kill, and hates his situation (gang leader)
1943: Franz Von Sickingen, Knight from the Holy Roman Empire, will die for Himmler to gain power.
1914: Franz Ferdinand, Archduke of Austria-Hungary, and built like a brick
44 BC: Sanada Yukimura, Samurai, Will kill anyone willing to stop his quest to overthrow the Romans for a chance at glory
Present day: Mike Felsing, chromed up with bodyguards to match

Players COULD kill Mike in any time period, but that would still leave the miniboss unattended, which could wreak havoc. In 1914, not really because Franz will die unless someone stops the assassin. 1943 would be minimal, but not returning sickingen or killing him could cause issues in his time period, same with Sanada and Aether.
Mike CANNOT be killed before the time machine is built however, because history should unfold as such:
Mike grows up, invents technology that revolutionizes agriculture, so the world can sustain its population (2008), and right before building the time machine invents a way to travel across the world in a much faster manner (accelerator for planes or something 2024). He then claims to have built a time machine that spectacularly fails and leaves him dead.

Players would not really be making money from these adventures, so maybe some light thievery could be in order. Money can be made by doing jobs in the present, but I mean you have a time machine so they would be stupid not to just exploit it. And why not travel to the future for better weapons? Just cant really use them outside of their time.
