  <h2> [BACKGROUND] </h2>
  <div class="container">
  <p class="center"><u>Revised story:</u>
So mike still did go back in time and mess some things up. Why? Because he was a little curious? He changed events (below) to see their effect on history. <b>He did this to save his family.</b> In the nuking of Night City 4 years ago, Mike was out of town on a science expo in the NUSA. His entire family was inside the city when it blew. He invented time travel to try and save them, the ai in the minivan was his daughter. He tried to go back 4 years to stop who ever blew up Night City with the nuke, but was greeted by a super human gang of villians. Realizing he could not get past them, he resigned to time traveling to another time period and trying to start over. In 1866, he tried to start a new family in the quaint town of Barstool. Unfortunatly the ruffians at this town caused too much havoc, and Mike put an end to them. He realized here that maybe he shouldn't be trying to start again, maybe he could change the past to change his future. He went back and changed the events below, then he got back. The future had not changed, sure he was a rich corp, or atleast another version of himself was, but his family was still gone. He made one last trip to [REDACTED] and when he came back, he was convinced. This had to be the event that would change it all. He got out of his car and BOOM...
  
Mike's younger self, the copro head of Brah Corp, does infact have his family. His daughter is alive, so is his wife. Mike knows about the time travel and what would happen if things were to go back to normal. So New Mike put goons in every time period to stop anyone from going back and changing the timeline, lest his family would be taken from him again. 
Players need to choose here, world prosperity or Mike's family. Mike will NOT stop, he would do anything to keep his family alive. Unfortunatly, no one would be living very long with the nuclear war with Rome looming, economic collapse of the NUSA on the brink, and other global wars.
  
  Continuity, been 4 years after night city got nuked by richard (unknown party). Gary and crew went into hiding never to be seen again (they exist, see [OLD CHARACTERS]) All metahumans have faded out of the public light and the rebuilding of Night City is almost done. However one man has made a machine capable of time travel [delorean ish]. He travels back in time and changes a lot of things:
1. Saves Franz Ferdinand’s life
2. Became a senator in ancient rome and saved caesars life. 
3. Kills hitler in 1943
4. Becomes sheriff in yellowstone in 1866, kills FDR’s ancestor here
5. Becomes mega rich through gambling and sports betting
Naturally this causes many things to change and time to break a bit. 
- Al Capone and others displaced into night city
- Italy is now Rome, and a bit bigger than normal, threatening nuclear war with US 
- Everything Hitler becomes Himmler
- WW1 still happened, but austria hungary still austria hungary in present, makes something not exist anymore
- WW2 stunted on both sides, US was not as economically sound and had significantly less impact in WW2, and Nazi’s crippled without Hitler. War ends in 1942, and many german innovations along with american inventions were created much later. (AV cars slow, unreliable, will blow up, very cutting edge). Japanese Empire still exists to this day, Japanese/Asian people seen as villains too…
- New corp emerging called “Brah Corp” built entirely out of gambling winnings

Players immune to effect because of a latent meta gene after the Resurrection. After all the changes, he comes back to the present to witness his changes, when he is shot the instant he leaves his car. “Who is this man?” you might be asking, well he is a man of many names…
Ancient Rome: Maximus Fortunas 
1866: Mike Felsing
1914: Max Fritz
1943: Matthew Fitzgerald
Present day (2024): Mike Felsing

Order in which times he went to these places are not mentioned anywhere, but he went in the order of:
Present → 1866 → 1943 → 1914 → 44 BC → 2018 → 2019 → 2020 → present day

Mike time jumps in with the time minivan, dies seems older, but then players later see mike on TV, younger. Time machine shows when he jumped to, not when he jumped from.
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

So maybe instead of going to times to stop the changes, bring the changes to them. One main quest to stop nuke war with rome. Bring caesar to night city or something. Still need a main main questline. Maybe jump to sim thing, players notice happenings like glitches, confronting mike at brah corp office can reveal sim?

Sim: players inserted into sim with other people to see who would be able to deal with effects of timetravel on their world, those who survive and solve the problem are brought out to work for brah corp against other corps? 
OR
Players inserted into sim to see what would happen if historical figures were brought to the future, like Al Capone and Julius Caesar. Players should adapt or try to fix the errors, those who cant will not pass this test.

So plot would be break free from the system (sort of grounded JAKE…) work for capone, steal from brah corp, notice that brah corp has some crazy gear to throw at players. (make brah corp like god) Caesar shows up with an army of romans (ancient) who ravage the city. Players need to stop, NUSA takes this as the REAL romans declaring war. War time… (rome war sidequest) 
Throughout do jobs for al. Eventually Samurai guy shows up seeking vengeance against Al Capone. Players can help or stop him. [WRITE REASON IN HIS BIO]
At some point, Brah Corp hires Aether to stop the theft of materials, big boss time. 
At this point, crossover episode needs to be done so AI can tell players that they need to break into Brah Corp HQ and grab something/kill real mike. Final mission btw

Rome war: players work their way to US govt to stop the war? Maybe travel to rome and end up meeting caesar or something

Crossover episode: getting borg bot body for minivan AI, Players need to learn about gary space station. Basically justice league HQ thing, currently where Gary, but not borg bot. Gary spill beans about what he did, where loot went and stuff. Players can convince gary of stuff if they try hard enough, but not joining a team again. Gary was persecuted by NUSA, so thats why he hides in space station.

Short term: players confronted by al capone, eliminate ron, gives option to work for them or end up like ron. Al makes them get more product, robbing convoys and what not. Could show one of the time villains here? Either way, Al pays them but not much. Growing tensions with other gangs, start gang war.
Mike in minivan boom into the scene after the first scene with al, mike starts saying stuff like “ah yeah brah, we just like-” then is eliminated by Al. “well boys looks like this ride is now free and im giving sign on bonuses.”

NOTES: 
-AI in minivan is actually a netrunner hacking into the sim, but the only way she got in was through the minivan and couldn’t really be out of character due to the intensity of the programs ran in the simulation. Tried giving hint, ended up sounding sarcastic.

  <h2> [STORY GUIDE] </h2>
  <div class="container">
  <p class="center">To stop the timeline from being messed up anymore players need to correct these events whether it be chronological or not. Basically a mini boss in each timeline, and players should try to correct events with era appropriate attire/weapons (some consequences if they don’t, depends on what they do)
Miniboss list:

Present: Al Capone, drug smuggler and new boss of Night City’s underground
1866: Aether Nova, Solo from 2179, born to kill, and hates his situation (gang leader)
1943: Franz Von Sickingen, Knight from the Holy Roman Empire, will die for Himmler to gain power.
1914: Franz Ferdinand, Archduke of Austria-Hungary, and built like a brick
44 BC: Sanada Yukimura, Samurai, Will kill anyone willing to stop his quest to overthrow the Romans for a chance at glory
Present day: Mike Felsing, chromed up with bodyguards to match

Players COULD kill Mike in any time period, but that would still leave the miniboss unattended, which could wreak havoc. In 1914, not really because Franz will die unless someone stops the assassin. 1943 would be minimal, but not returning sickingen or killing him could cause issues in his time period, same with Sanada and Aether.
Mike CANNOT be killed before the time machine is built however, because history should unfold as such:
Mike grows up, invents technology that revolutionizes agriculture, so the world can sustain its population (2008), and right before building the time machine invents a way to travel across the world in a much faster manner (accelerator for planes or something 2024). He then claims to have built a time machine that spectacularly fails and leaves him dead.

Players would not really be making money from these adventures, so maybe some light thievery could be in order. Money can be made by doing jobs in the present, but I mean you have a time machine so they would be stupid not to just exploit it. And why not travel to the future for better weapons? Just cant really use them outside of their time.
