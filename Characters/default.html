  <p class="center">Mike isn’t really a bad guy, he just messed with time, so times gotta mess with him back. An accomplished scientist, Mike has revolutionized agriculture and transportation while also finding a way to time travel. After the whole meta human incident, Mike knew that outlandish ideas might be true, causing him to develop time travel. His goal at first was to just see the old west, maybe live there a while. But after becoming sheriff in the old west, he realized he had the power to right the wrongs of history. From there he goes on his quest to change bad events in history and see how they would unfold in the present day. After saving caesar, he realized he could do a lot more scientific work if he had more money and was his own boss. Gambling his life away, he made a ton of money at various casinos of the world. Starting his own company called Brah Corp to invent new stuff. Currently creating high value drugs, some prototyping (!!). Create other mechanical innovations too.

Upon arriving in Night City, he has gained a mass of bodies to his Mafia where he intends to take over the Night City Underground. His main source of income is the new drugs that Brah Corp is producing. All of his goons should be equipped with tommy guns, as class/style is always above function.

  <p class="center">Infamous Solo of 2179, Aether has more kills than anyone in her time. Equipped with the most latest cyberware and weaponry, Aether is unstoppable at imposing her will in 1866. Once displaced she took out nearly every gang leader and joined them into her own gang. Master of CQC, Aether wields a sword that doubles as a gun. In the wild west, Aether is out of her element, lack of technology and quick transportation, not to mention electricity, has hindered her fighting capability. What made her one of the best was the power armor that made her virtually bulletproof, stolen from [CORP NAME]. Without a way to power the suit, she has taken some pieces off of it to make a makeshift armor she can wear without needing to power the suit.

In order to keep up with the times, the chestpiece of the plate mail is a thicker steel plate to stop most bullet calibers.

Kiriko cares for Cass, even though Cass does not treat her with the most respect. She stayed with him because of his irresistible charm, and funny quips. Deep down he was a good person, but always wanted to be fishing rather than hanging out with her. Recently she met a man named Nate Demic, maybe she will take Cass' advice...
