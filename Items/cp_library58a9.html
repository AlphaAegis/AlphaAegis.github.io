<h1>Nova Express</h1>
</center><br>
<div class="c">
<p><i>Nova Express</i> is a postmodern science fiction novel written by William S. Burroughs. It was published in 1964. It is third in a trilogy of science fiction novels : <i>The Soft Machine</i>, <i>The Ticket That Exploded</i> and <i>Nova Express</i>.</p>
<br>
<h3>Synopsis</h3>
<p>This sequel to the <i>Soft Machine</i> continues to aim at shooting holes in the phoney fabrications of our indoctrinated minds. Before pulling the trigger it chats away with us at random like the friendly policeman, but his sentences don't make sense in the normal way, they're like shreds of human tissue that fall on us like snow : somewhere there must have been an explosion. Before our fearfully closed eyes we see flashes of the fight between the invader and the protectors. But is what is defended worth to behold ? The severed phrases turn slowly and with intervals into trancelike asymmetric symphonies of mindturning poetry. An abstract message is communicated. The gun that was pointing at you slips into your hand. A terrible truth.</p>
