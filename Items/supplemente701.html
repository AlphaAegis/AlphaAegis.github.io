		<h4>Review</h4>
		<p>And hop, like buns, Chromebooks are multiplying. This one, which is thicker than its predecessors, boasts a more meticulous layout and beautiful illustrations, for the most part. This time, the softwares are back with a whole chapter dedicated to cyberdecks and their customization. The classic sections on equipment, cybernetics and vehicles are still there, and we find as a bonus some new FBC (see ChromeBook 2) and ACPA (see Maximum Metal). In addition, there are drones and modified animals, as well as a chapter of rules on the maintenance of equipment and cybernetics. In spite of the care given to the supplement, the magic of Chromebook is a bit stale, and one has a feeling of almost constant déjà vu. Except for some nice vehicles and the passage on drones, the rest is not very original, either extending the content of previous Chromebooks, or that of Maximum Metal. No reason to throw oneself on it.</p>
