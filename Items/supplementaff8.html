		<h4>Review</h4>
		<p>The novel &quot;Hardwired&quot; by Walter Jon Williams is for me one of the best of the Cyberpunk family. Unfortunately, this supplement does not live up to what it is inspired by, despite the author's collaboration. The background only summarizes what we already know after reading the book, and doesn't go in depth. The alternative system is simplistic. Some details about implants or drugs may be nice, but again, it lacks substance. As for the passage on computers, while it has the merit of being less stupid than CP2020, it quickly turns into a lesson for beginners, which is no better. And to finish us off, thirty pages of unoriginal mini-scenarios that we could have done without. In short, buy the novel and avoid the supplement, whose illustrations are hideous except for the magnificent cover of Royo. Another supplement based on a work exists : it is called When Gravity Fails.</p>
