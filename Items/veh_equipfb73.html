		This can be hand-carried or vehicle-mounted (if hand-carried, it weighs 1 kg). This little device tells artillery spotters the range to the target using a small laser, calculates the hang time and weapon azimuth, etc... It practically does everything but aim the gun ! Heavy Weapons skill is required to use it, and it adds a +10 bonus to any artillery to hit roll when used by a spotter. For an additional 500 euro, it can be outfitted with a painting laser that can guide laser-seeking missiles.<br class="c">

		Reactive armor is a series of explosive charges that explodes in opposition to shaped-charge projectiles, disrupting their attack. When a vehicle with reactive armor is hit by a shaped-charge attack (rocket or missile), roll 1D10. On a 2-10 the armor explodes outward, halving the penetration of the attack. Subtract 1 from the D10 roll for every two shaped-charge or high-explosive hits that the vehicle has taken. For instance, an APC with reactive armor comes under attack by a PA suit armed with a missile launcher and a 20mm cannon. The suit operator, realizing that his missile stands a good chance of &quot;bouncing&quot; if he doesn't do something about the armor, hoses the APC with 20mm HE, scoring 6 hits. Assuming he's still alive on the next turn, he can launch his missile and it only has a 60% chance of being disrupted by the reactive armor (instead of the 90% chance there was before).<br>Reactive armor can be replaced after battles, at the original cost. Since this involves putting a bunch of small charges on the vehicle, it's a simple job and only takes about 15 minutes. 1 space of cargo holds enough charges to replace almost any vehicle's reactive armor once.<br class="c">

If a system is damaged, the Damage Control system allows it to continue function as if undamaged on a 1D10 roll of 6-10. Make this roll when the system is damaged; if the roll is 5 or less, the system in question is damaged and unusable until repaired. If the roll is 6+, the system is treated as undamaged, which means it might be damaged again in the future, requiring a new damage control roll.

		This system uses radar/sonar to detect incoming projectiles and detonate fragmentation charges in an attempt to destroy or deflect the incoming projectiles. Like the AGAMS, if a missile or other slow-moving projectile is fired at the vehicle with the AEAMS, the radar detects it 90% of the time (roll a D10; on a 1, the system fails to detect the incoming projectile). For the purpose of detection, the system's sensing threshold is set at an object no smaller than 10 cm by 10cm by 20 cm, moving at a velocity between 100-500m per second, which means it works on any rocket weapon. Once a missile has been detected, the AEAMS &quot;fires&quot; an explosive at it. This explosive discharge has a 90% chance of destroying or diverting the missile. The AEAMS works as well against multiple targets as against one target, since the vehicle has charges mounted at all angles. These charges can even be used as an anti-personnel system, since each charge is equivalent to a Claymore mine (the vehicle's armor absorbs the backblast. Damage is 5D6 and burst area is 4m line from the center). This requires that a crewmember set them off manually, instead of shooting a regular weapon. AEAMS charges do run out, and the fewer charges the vehicle has, the less chance of knocking out incoming missiles. For every four charges that the vehicle has used at the beginning of a missile/rocket attack, the chance of successfully destroying an incoming missile drops by 10%. As noted, replacement charges cost 1000 euro (this replaces all the vehicle's AEAMS charges). These replacements can be carried as cargo in a grenade box which weighs 60 kg when loaded. Replacing the AEAMS charges takes 15 minutes.<br class="c">

		Based on the .22 minigun design, this system detects missiles with radar and douses them with a hail of slugs to destroy them before they hit. The system includes its own integral radar (additional sonar-based detection system available for 5000 euro).<br>If a missile or other slow-moving projectile is fired at the vehicle with the AGAMS, the radar detects it 90% of the time (roll a D10; on a 1, the system fails to detect the incoming projectile). For the purpose of detection, the system's sensing threshold is set at an object no smaller than 10 cm by 10 cm by 20 cm, moving at a velocity between 100-500m per second. This means it works on any rocket weapon.<br>Once the system has detected an incoming missile, it attempts to shoot it down once in range (100m). The system can be confused by multiple projectiles, its concentration diluted as it attempts to handle all available targets. Roll 1D10 for each missile detected, -1 for each missile. On a roll of 4+, the missile is safely destroyed. On a roll of 1-3, the missile is detonated within its burst radius, attacking the target with 1/2 its usual penetration factor. On a roll of 0 or less, the AGAMS fails to destroy the missile and it attacks the target as normal.<br class="c">

		An auto-pilot allows the driver to program a destination into a vehicle and leave the driving to the vehicle. Auto-pilots are very simple drivers, moving the vehicle along a simple, pre­programmed route to its destination. Navigational directions are provided in two ways. In urban areas, the auto-pilot links into a navdata system via radio (all 2020 vehicles come equipped with this sort of radio/transponder system), and the city traffic computers help guide the vehicle safely to its destination (note : this system also allows city authorities to monitor and track vehicles with­in the urban area. Disabling the transponder to prevent this is usually illegal). Alternatively, the auto-pilot can be hooked into an onboard navigation system (see below). The auto-pilot handles regular road problems (traffic, speed, etc...) very competently, counting as a total Driver +5 skill (meaning that the autopilot rolls 1D10 and adds 5 when making Driver/Piloting rolls).

Part of this option includes sensor gear integrated into the vehicle : cameras for &quot;eyes&quot;, sonic receptors for &quot;ears&quot;, full tie-ins to all other sensors and communications devices, etc. Cybernetic Linkage allows more precise vehicle control : all vehicle control rolls, maneuvers, and combat rolls are at +2 skill when using a cybernetic link.<br>Such linkage also allows a single person to control more than one vehicular function at a time. This is less accurate and precise than concentrating on one action; each vehicle function handled in the same turn gives a cumulative -1 to skill, in addition to the +2 bonus. For instance, a pilot flying an AV while firing the minigun and using the sensors has a -1 to all three actions (-1 for piloting, -1 for firing a weapon, -1 for monitoring the sensors, +2 for cybernetic linkage). Each crew position in a cyber-equipped vehicle is usually fitted with a jack for data-plugs.

		Electronics Counter-CounterMeasures is a system of fine-tuned electronics used to punch through jamming. On a 1D10 roll of 4-10, it negates the effects of jamming.

		Electronic CounterMeasures is a sophisticated electronics system that is used to baffle, jam and mask electronics emissions and operation. In game terms, its use is simplified : ECM is either on or off. When on, the vehicle is attempting to jam the electronics around it. Jamming can extend out to 100m, thereby protecting everything out to a 100m radius. ECM can be extended to greater ranges, at a higher price : 500m, 1 million eb.; 1 km, 2 million eb., 2 spaces; 10 km, 5 million eb., 5 spaces; 100 km, 15 million eb., 10 spaces; 250 km, 50 million eb., 20 spaces. There are larger jammers, but they're too big to be mounted in vehicles and are ground-installed.<br>ECM jamming has the following effects : it jams radar and radio (it automatically jams civilian radar/radio. For military radar/radio, roll 1D10 per turn; on a 4-10, the radar is jammed), and it jams radar-guided missiles, adding +15 Difficulty to hit.<br class="c">

		Thermal imagers negate darkness penalties to combat and Notice/Awareness rolls. In addition, thermal imagers provide a +5 bonus to Notice/ Awareness rolls when looking for hot (125+ degree) targets. At 10m range, thermal imagers can &quot;see&quot; through solid walls, detecting hot targets (such as people, heating ducts, etc...).

Datasuits come in a variety of colors and patterns and are made by several different companies. Due to the tight fit and variations in height, weight and structure each datasuit is custom made for the specific wearer and cost varies depending on manufacturer and design.
