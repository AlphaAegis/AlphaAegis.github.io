<div class="c">
<blockquote><p><i>When you read Pat Cadigan's stories, you'll swear she's been 1) a psychopath 2) a pimp 3) a junkie 4) to Mars, because she can write so well of places you don't ever want to visit and people you never ever ever want to meet. She hasn't been any of those things; what she is is another typical beautiful genius foulmouthed Supermom from K.C. whose works cause me to bite holes in my desk every time I read a new one.</i><br>
-- Howard Waldrop, author of <i>Them Bones</i>.</p>
</blockquote><br>
<p>Patterns is a short story collection by Pat Cadigan. It was published in 1989.</p>
<p>In Pat Cadigan's tales, social issues morph into monstrous fantasy-like the what happens to Milo, the kid who's always left out, in the chilling <i>Eenie, Meenie, Ipsateenie</i>. The story <i>Heal</i> will keep the likes of Jim and Tammy Faye Bakker awake at night, pale and unblinking in their beds. Particularly harrowing is the tale <i>My Brother's Keeper</i>, in which a girl's struggle to rescue her brother from heroin addiction uncovers something far uglier going on in the dark recesses of the inner city.</p>
<p><i>Patterns</i> is reminiscent of Ray Bradbury's short stories, but with malevolent twists and psychotic turns that leave the reader waiting on tenterhooks for the final punch line. Fans of Cadigan's work will particularly enjoy the introductions she has written for each story. Those wanting to read her for the first time may find her novels a better introduction.</p>
