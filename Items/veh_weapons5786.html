<title>Artillery weapons</title>
</head>
<body>
<div class="c"><h2>ARTILLERY WEAPONS</h2><p><p>Artillery weapons are usually used in groups of identical weapons, so that they can be fired in salvos. This adds to the size of the burst area.<br>Rockets fired indirectly use indirect fire rules for scatter, and have a burst area equal to the burst area of the rocket times the number of rockets fired. Other artillery weapons have a burst area of one weapon plus 1/2 the burst area per additional weapon fired in the salvo.</p><b>Note</b>: artillery weapons use high-explosive shells, their penetration is not affected by range.<br>* Composite Armor halves penetration.<br>Mortars have a minimum range of 1/100 their maximum range.<h3>ARTILLERY AMMUNITION</h3><p>These alternative round fillers can be used by any artillery weapon but the grenade launchers. The 230 mm rocket cannot use Armor-Piercing or Cluster-Bomblet rounds (it's both).</p><p><b>Armor-Piercing</b>: for howitzers only. Doubles the cost of the shell and reduces the Burst to 0. Doubles Penetration on the 105 mm, triples the Penetration on the 150 mm and 200 mm.</p><p><b>Chemical</b>: the shell is filled with gas or smoke. Triple the Burst, no Penetration. Smoke shells cost 1/3 normal, hot smoke (blocks IR and thermographs) costs normal, tear gas costs dou­ble, knock-out gas costs triple, and nerve gas costs 20 times normal.</p><p><b>Cluster Bomblet</b>: the shell is loaded with bomblets. Double the price, triple the Burst, reduce Penetration to 4.</p><p><b>HEAT</b>: this substitutes a shaped-charge war­head for the normal high-explosive. Double the shell cost, double the Penetration (and halve it again if attacking Composite Armor) and reduce the Burst to 4m. Works best when combined with Laser-Guided.</p><p><b>Laser-Guided</b>: a laser-guided shell follows a painting laser to its target. On the turn when the shell hits, if there is a laser painting the target spot, the shell strikes that spot on a D10 roll of 4-10, otherwise it scatters 2D10 meters on the Grenade Table. Triple the base cost of the shell.</p><p><b>Rocket-Assisted Shells</b>: artillery shells with rocket boosters. Double the range and number of spaces the shell takes up, triple the base cost of the shell.</p><p><b>White Phosphorous</b>: anyone hit with WP sustains 3D6 burn damage to that location per turn for at least a half-hour, or until the WP fragments are removed. If the fragment hits body armor, it does its damage to the armor, doing full damage to kevlar and armorjackets (only flak jackets, doorgunner's vests, Metalgear and Powered Armor is proof against it). For instance, an area protected by an SP14 armor-jacket takes 11 points of damage from WP. The jacket is reduced to SP 3 at that location, and will be burned through next turn. If the fragment hits flesh, it burns its way in and will have to be removed surgically (skillful use of a knife or other sharp probe can do the trick if applied on the first three turns of WP burn). WP shells cost four times normal.</p></p><p>&nbsp;</p>

	This is a massive pod filled with a dozen massive rockets. These rockets are loaded with multiple-bomblet warheads, and can cover a huge area with grenade-equivalent bombs.
