<h3>Synopsis</h3>
<p><i>Michael Marshall Smith's Only Forward is a dark labyrinth of a book : shocking, moving and surreal. Violent, outrageous and witty - sometimes simultaneously - it offers us a journey from which we return both shaken and exhilarated. An extraordinary debut.</i><br>
-- Clive Barker</p>
<p>Stark is an investigator. We don't know of what, but he thinks he's good. When he's called in to find Fell Ackland who has disappeared, Stark sets out on a journey which will take him through the many neighbourhoods in the vast city he lives in. Neighbourhoods such as Colour, where the walls will coordinate with your clothes; Cat, where only Cats live and Red, where gang warfare is the favoured pastime. Quickly things move from a simple missing person job into something far more disturbing and deadly. It does have some talking technology too !</p>
