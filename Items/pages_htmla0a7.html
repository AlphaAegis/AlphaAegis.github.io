<h2>BE CORPORATE</h2>
<img src="interface/be_corporate.jpg" class="r"><p>The cyberpunk world is rather big gun, gang warfare and cybernetics oriented, and it's normal that players are attracted by solos, nomadic and other joyfulness. But the corporatist world often stays in the background behind almighty NPCs. It's time to discover this world and its rules. However, there are a few things you should know before getting started.</p>
<h3>I've got the power !</h3>
<p>Indeed the corporatist is very powerful. He gets his power from the powerful machine that is his corporation. Where the other players will go to get their hands on the game, the corpo will do everything (or almost everything) from his desk or via his phone. He will be able to access advanced technologies, build troops and send them wherever they are needed, but most importantly, he will stay away from the filthy bottom. Moreover, his motivations are quite different because he already has everything (or almost everything).<br>
All this is very attractive but every medal has its reverse side. To be able to evolve and do what he wants, the corpo will have to face the imperatives of corporatist politics. In fact, there is a whole protocol or &quot;Commandment&quot; so that the corporation is not subject to controversy. Thus, any operation that goes wrong rarely sees its sponsor remain in its place, or even disappear suddenly.<br>
But success also attracts the jealousy and mistrust of other corpos, and it is not uncommon for a rival in a position to give himself the means to eject or ruin the career of an opponent.<br>
It's in this precarious but nevertheless enjoyable balance that a corpo evolves.</p>
<h3>GM : &quot;He's going to ruin my campaign&quot;</h3>
<p>Indeed the real concern for the GM will be to integrate a corpo to a &quot;normal&quot; team (although one may wonder what is normal in Cyberpunk).<br>
Due to the nature of the character, he is excluded from any possibility to go and run the local gang or personally carry out other misdeeds. That's why the GM must avoid one-night stands and improvisation, because the corpo rarely has a place in it and ends up either being killed (if he participates) or standing around partying or providing material (not very rewarding for a player). As for the cops, to be really playable, the only option left is the corporatist campaign option. It's a huge job for the GM because he'll have to manage also the corporation(s) that will enter in conflict (direct or indirect).<br>
Moreover, some GMs can be afraid of the power that a corpo can have. But there are still some strings left that always work like a recalcitrant superior, a last minute mission or file that needs to be closed quickly, or a rival that is a bit too vindictive.<br>
In short, you are the Master.</p>
<h3>And in the beginning he was the best</h3>
<p>The first thing when creating a corporatist character is to start with his background, his motivations, his character traits.<br>
Once fixed on his attitude, it will be easier to give more or less points to his characteristics. For the choice of the corporation it is up to the GM to make a presentation on the corporations present in Cyberpunk, explaining their sectors of activity and their general policies. Indeed the corporation will become like a family for the player; better that he likes it.<br>
Let's move on to the essential statistics for a corporation. First of all Intelligence (to be able to achieve its ends), Empathy because the corporatist world is a &quot;human&quot; environment and it is better to understand people.<br>
Not to omit the Cool which in certain situations can be essential (especially to resist intimidation) and Attractiveness, a real joker to evolve socially. As far as skills are concerned, the first and no less important is the special Resources skill. Not only does it indicate the ease with which the corpo obtains the support of its corporation, but it also indicates its status within the corpo.<br>
Beware, wanting too much power can be dangerous or uncontrollable for both the GM and the player to make a well-considered decision in this area.<br>
The other skills are :<br>
Persuasion & Fast Talk, which allows one to overcome some obstacles, Leadership (mandatory to remain credible), Human Perception to better understand people and to guess half-truths, Social to stand in society, Library Search and Education, indispensable at work, Accounting to maintain budgets (or distort them) and Oratory to make oneself heard. Finally, don't forget Personal Grooming (style is everything at Cyberpunk), Interrogation to get the best out of a discussion, Stock Market for speculators (see the page on <a href="pages_htmlbf03.html?html=bourse&amp;lng=us">stock market investments</a>), Intimidation for respect and a skill related to the corporation's field of activity.</p>
<p>Here you are ready to approach Cyberpunk from another side, that of corporations. But beware of surprises, you never know what a file hides...</p>
