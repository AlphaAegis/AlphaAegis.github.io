<h3>Synopsis</h3>
<p><i>Brilliantly written and scary as hell. A masterpiece.</i><br>
-- Stephen King</p>
<p><i>The Straw Men</i> is MMS' fourth novel but his first under the name &quot;Michael Marshall&quot;. According to reports it's much less science-fictiony than the previous novels and will be marketed as a thriller. From reading the descriptions it does appear to have a certain &quot;horrific&quot; element to it, so we shouldn't feel out of place. The book appears to deal with the actions of a group called &quot;The Straw Men&quot; who kill without apparent purpose and the work of one man who goes up against them.</p>
