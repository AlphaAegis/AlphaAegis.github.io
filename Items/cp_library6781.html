<h1>All Tomorrow's Parties</h1>
</center><br>
<div class="c">
<p><i>All Tomorrow's Parties</i> is part of &quot;San Francisco trilogy&quot; with Gibson's earlier novels <i>Virtual Light</i> and <i>Idoru</i> and includes characters from both of them.</p>
<br>
<h3>Synopsis</h3>
<p>Although Colin Laney (from Gibson's earlier novel <i>Idoru</i>) lives in a cardboard box, he has the power to change the world. Thanks to an experimental drug that he received during his youth, Colin can see &quot;nodal points&quot; in the vast streams of data that make up the worldwide computer network. Nodal points are rare but significant events in history that forever change society, even though they might not be recognizable as such when they occur. Colin isn't quite sure what's going to happen when society reaches this latest nodal point, but he knows it's going to be big. And he knows it's going to occur on the Bay Bridge in San Francisco, which has been home to a sort of SoHo-esque shantytown since an earthquake rendered it structurally unsound to carry traffic.</p>
<p>Colin sends Barry Rydell (last seen in Gibson's novel <i>Virtual Light</i>) to the bridge to find a mysterious killer who reveals himself only by his lack of presence on the Net. Barry is also entrusted with a strange package that seems to be the home of Rei Toi, the computer-generated &quot;idol singer&quot; who once tried to &quot;marry&quot; a human rock star (also from <i>Idoru</i>). Barry and Rei Toi are eventually joined by Barry's old girlfriend Chevette (from <i>Virtual Light</i>) and a young boy named Silencio who has an unnatural fascination with watches. Together this motley assortment of characters holds the key to stopping billionaire Cody Harwood from doing whatever it is that will make sure he still holds the reigns of power after the nodal point takes place.</p>
