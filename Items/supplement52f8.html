		<h4>Review</h4>
		<p>Ianus Games was able to surprise, because after the release of Night's Edge, there was nothing to suggest such an evolution of the range. This supplement is part of Alternate Realities, just like Night's Edge, Dark Metropolis, Sub Attica and Blood Lust. This supplement is full of ideas and rules to deal with situations that finally give a human and tragic dimension to Cyberpunk. In bulk, it talks about stress and its impact on daily life, cyberpsychosis and mental disorders. Once this section is over, we enter the heart of the matter with a big part on cults and different dangerous cults, the new voodoo, the bogeymen of 2020 (murderers, drug addicts, terrorists...), virtual universes, sleep and dreams, as well as witchcraft and different kinds of magic. As you can see, there is food and drink in this copious supplement. Personally I loved it, even if many elements are only suggestions and need to be reworked. Indeed, the persistence of old myths (the bogeyman) and the resurgence of old beliefs (voodoo, magic...) can be the source of prodigiously rich adventures in a high-tech world where people cling to their superstition. This supplement is really excellent.</p>
