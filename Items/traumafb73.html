<a id="trauma10"></a><h2 align="center">TTI Medical AV-4A</h2>
<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>When a TTI Card is activated, this is the standard Trauma Team International unit that responds.<br>
The aerodyne is a McDonnell Douglas AV-4A Tactical Urban Assault Vehicle with a customized body. Powered by a single Rolls-Royce Pegasus II Vectored Thrust Turbofan, with 9628 kgs. of thrust, it is capable of speeds up to 565 km/h and has a maximum operational radius of 645 km.</p>

<h3>Airframe/Structure</h3>
<p>Fully loaded, the AV-4A weighs 4773 kg. This light weight is the result of extensive use of composite materials in both the chassis and the body. Also, thanks to the use of aramid/epoxy laminate in the outer body, the AV is extremely resistant to small arms fire and light anti-vehicle weapons (body has an SP of 25 and an SDP of 60). The interior of the AV-4 is divided into two sections : the cockpit (forward compartment) and the &quot;med-bay&quot; (aft compartment).</p>
<p>The cockpit is separated from the aft compartment by a reinforced bulkhead (SP 15, SDP 10) and has an isolated air filtration system. An intercom system keeps the pilot and co-pilot/gunner in contact with the rest of the crew at all times. The cockpit is accessed via a hatch into the aft compartment, or directly to the exterior via lockable doors to the port and starboard.</p>
<p>The aft compartment, or &quot;med-bay&quot; can also be sealed if necessary and is accessed via large sliding doors, port and starboard, in the sides of the fuselage. Both doors are equipped with explosive bolts that can be activated either from the cockpit or from the med-bay.</p>

<h3>Armament</h3>
<p>The TTI AV-4A is also very capable of fighting back, albeit in a limited fashion. In addition to the small arms carried by all of the crew members, the ship itself is armed with twin Goncz-Taurus 7.62 mm minigun (in an underslung nosepod, controlled by the co-pilot / gunner) and one Sternmeyer M-5A SAW (7.62C) on a retractable pintle mount for each door gunner.</p>

<h3>Crew</h3>
<p>The TTI AV-4A is manned by a crew of six specialists, as follows :</p>
<ul>

</ul>

<h3>Interior Layout & Details</h3>
<p align="center"><img src="interface/AV-4A_plan_us.jpg"></p>
<p>The Trauma Team AV-4A packs a tremendous amount of life-saving equipment into an amazingly small volume. Each crew-member has an assigned position and, during transport, is seated in a McDonnell Douglas ACES III (Advanced Concept Ejection Seat) rocket-powered, acceleration-damped, ejection seat equipped with a vectored-thrust pitch control system and a 5-point harness. It is capable of zero-zero performance, and is cleared for use up to a height of 15000 meters and a speed of 1100 km/h, which far exceeds the operational envelope of the AV-4A.</p>

<h3>Cockpit</h3>
<p>The pilot and co-pilot/gunner (CPG) operate in a &quot;glass cockpit&quot;, which boasts 5 LCD MFDs (Multi-Functional Displays) and an independent HUD (Heads-Up Display) for each crew-member. Flight controls are very similar to that of a conventional helicopter, and consist of a cyclic joystick and a collective lever (to the left). Additionally, the Litton NR760 TADS/PNVS (Target Acquisition Designation System / Pilots Night Vision System) is coupled to the helmets of both the pilot and CPG, with output visible via either neural jack or flip-down visual reticle. Additionally, the CPG's helmet is equipped with &quot;look down, shoot down&quot; IR position indicators, such that the weapons turret points where the CPG looks. A cross-hair image is provided for the CPG either via smartgun link (+2 to hit) or via helmet reticle (+1 to hit). The system provides both cockpit crew-members with the equivalent of Low Light, Thermograph and TeleOptic vision, for all views external to the AV.</p>

<h3>Communications</h3>
<p>The AV-4A cockpit is equipped with 3 independent 2-way radio systems : 2 Sabre 1200 FM commo suites (one for city frequencies, the other for county frequencies) and 1 Sabre 2100 FADES (Frequency-Agile, Dual Encryption Security) Tactical Communication System. The latter system is used exclusively for communicating either with the local TTI base, or with other TTI vehicles. The &quot;med-bay&quot; (aft compartment) is equipped with a Body Weight Med-Line 2000 voice/vision/fax/data Transceiver set. This unit is connected directly to the cryo-tank (below), which allows direct transmission of patient vitals to TTI Medical Control. It can also accept a wide variety of data disks and chips to facilitate diagnosis.</p>

<h3>Avionics & Countermeasures</h3>
<p>The AV is equipped with an APG-85 multi-mode, all-weather, Pulse-Doppler &quot;smart&quot; radar. It has an operational range of 50 km against targets with an RCS (Radar Cross-Section) similar to the AV-4. It includes TWS (Track-While-Scan), NCTR (Non-Cooperative Target Recognition) and a &quot;look down&quot; SAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar) mode which can produce an almost photographic-quality monochrome image. This is an invaluable feature when approaching a potentially hot LZ. Further, the AV is equipped with flare and millimeter chaff dispensers, mounted to the ventral aft fuselage.</p>

<h3>Medical Equipment</h3>
<p>Of course, all of the other features of the TTI AV-4A exist solely to support it's primary function : the transport of sick and/or injured clients. To this end, the AV is packed with state-of-the-art emergency medical equipment and supplies.</p>
<p>The heart of the AV is the BodyWeight CR-2000 &quot;Last Chance&quot; Life Pod (combination bio-bed / cryo-tank). This marvel of medical technology serves two major funtions. The &quot;bio-bed&quot; function provides the EMTs with a &quot;Super Gurney&quot; which warms, cushions, restrains and generally protects the patient. It also has built-in bio-monitor and &quot;smart&quot; IV controller, as well as a Portable Intern Unit (ChromeBook 3, pg. 7 : +2 to the Diagnose skill and +1 to stabilization attempts).</p>
<p>When damage is too severe, the &quot;cryo-tank&quot; comes into play. Once the patient is placed in the tank, a BodyWeight VC-100 Vascular Shunt (AKA &quot;Vampire Cuff&quot;) is placed around the patients neck. The shunt automatically locates the external carotid arteries and the external jugular veins, and inserts bypass cannulas which immediately begin circulating oxygenated heme substitute to the brain. Once the shunt is activated, multiple doses of RBA (Radicals Binding Agent or &quot;Rhythym & Blues&quot; as it is frequently called) are injected throughout the body to prevent free radicals from accelerating cellular breakdown. An ET tube is inserted to flush the lungs with moist, oxygenated air and sealing tape is used on the nose and mouth. The cryo-tank is then closed and flooded with aerated, electrolytically balanced suspension gel, cooled to a temperature of -4° C. The patient is thus stabilized for delivery to the nearest critical care facility.</p>
<p>Additional standard equipment consists of :</p>

<ul>
	<li>1 Cardio-Vert LifePak 550P Monitor/Defibrillator/Pacer with recorder.</li>
	<li>1 Nonin 9100 Fingertip Pulse Oximeter.</li>
	<li>2 Sigma 8500 IV Pumps : accepts regular IV tubings made by Abbott, McGaw, Travenol Baxter.</li>
	<li>1 Abbot / Litton 3020 Drug Analyzer : see CP2020 Rule Book, pg. 71.</li>
	<li>2 Hewlett-Packard 120L Medscanners : see CP2020 Rule Book, pg. 71.</li>

<h2>Individual Items</h2>
<p><b>ALS :</b> Advanced Life Support.</p>
<p><b>BP cuff :</b> Blood Pressure cuff.</p>
<p><b>BLS :</b> Basic Life Support.</p>
<p><b>Bulb Aspirator :</b> A round rubber vacuum bulb with a tapered tip, used to suction fluid from body orifaces..</p>
<p><b>Cadaver Pouch :</b> Commonly known as &quot;body bags&quot;, these large zippered vinyl bags are used to contain and transport a corpse, usually from the scene of an accident or crime to the morgue.</p>
<p><b>Chux Pad :</b> A large disposable pad consisting of a thick layer of highly absorbant batting with a waterproof synthetic backing. These are frequently used in childbirth, and any other medical situation where a large amount of blood or other body fluid may be discharged.</p>
<p><b>Emesis Basin :</b> Small, shallow kidney-shaped pans, usually made of aluminum or stainless steel. Used to collect any oral discharge from the patient.</p>
<p><b>IO Kit :</b> IntraOsseous kit. Used to provide an intravenous feed into the marrow region of a major bone when venous puncture sites are not available. Frequently used on pediatric patients due to the difficulty of starting successful IVs on such small veins.</p>
<p><b>Jamshidi Needle :</b> A long, tapered combination needle/drill, used for bone core and marrow biopsies, and for intraosseous introduction of fluids and medication in pediatric patients.</p>
<p><b>KED :</b> Kendrick Extraction Device. A versatile, improved means of immobilizing and extricating patients from auto accidents or confined spaces. The color-coded straps make application simple even in the dark or in extremely cramped areas. Straps are held in place, out of the way, until needed. The wraparound design provides horizontal flexibility for easy application and vertical rigidity for maximum support during extrication. Immobilizes torso, head and neck enabling prompt extrication while minimizing risk of further injury. Adapts for children and pregnant women.</p>
<p><b>Laryngoscope :</b> An instrument to provide illumination to the glottis so as to facilitate passing an endotracheal tube through the patient's vocal cords. Laryngoscopes can also be used to examine for any pathology (edema, bleeding, polyps, fibrosis). The most popular laryngoscope, the Macintosh design, is curved so that the end fits into the vallecula, lifting the epiglottis out of the way to expose the vocal cords. Special laryngoscopes also exist, such as the straight blade (Miller) design (passed posterior to the epiglottis, avoiding the vallecula).</p>
<p><b>LifePak :</b> Brand name of the Cardio-Vert LifePak 550P Monitor/Defibrillator/Pacer.</p>
<p><b>Luer Adapter :</b> An adapter that connects a tapered Luer fitting (square nib) of a syringe to a tube or tube fitting.</p>
<p><b>Luer Syringe :</b> A disposable syringe that uses a luer-type connection between the needle and syringe body.</p>
<p><b>Oxygen Cylinder :</b> A compressed gas bottle containing 400 liters of oxygen (O<sub>2</sub>) for model D, 3450 for model M. In the U.S., medical O<sub>2</sub> bottles are color-coded green.</p>
<p><b>MAST / PASG :</b> Military Anti-Shock Trousers. Also know as PASG (Pneumatic Anti-Shock Garment). High-waisted inflatable pants that reach from the base of the ribcage to the ankle. When inflated, they cause lower body vascular compression, which forces blood back into the upper body and thus helps to prevent shock. Care should be taken in using these on patients with severe lower body trauma, as the constant absence of blood to the wound areas can accelerate the onset of tissue necrosis (gangrene).</p>
<p><b>NP Airway :</b> Nasopharyngeal airway. Airway tubing designed to ventilate the patient through a nostril and down into the trachea.</p>
<p><b>Nasal Cannula :</b> Tubing (typically plastic) for providing oxygen to the patient. The tube ends under the patients nose with twin outlets (one for each nostril).</p>
<p><b>Nebulizer :</b> A device for introducing atomized fluid into a patients airway. Frequently used as a humidifier or to administer liquid medication orally.</p>
<p><b>Stretcher, Reeves :</b> A semi-flexible stretcher (removeable stiffening ribs run lengthwise inside the stetcher) used to facilitate moving patients through tight openings or down steep stairs.</p>
<p><b>Stretcher, Scoop :</b> Used to minimize lifting or &quot;logrolling&quot; the patient when loading. Scoop stretchers separate (down the long axis) into two halve which each slide under the patient on either side and then reconnect.</p>
<p><b>Tegaderm :</b> A sterile film dressing with excellent oxygen and moisture permeability. Commonly used to secure IV catheters.</p>
<p><b>Vacutainer :</b> A sealed, evacuated glass sample tube with a needle penetrable rubber top. Typically used to collect blood samples. Available in varying sizes (w/ color-coded tops).</p>
<p><b>Yankauer Tip :</b> A suction tip with a large opening surrounded by a bulbous head. So designed to allow effective suction without aspiration of surrounding tissue.</p><br>

<p><b>Glasgow coma scale : </b>This scale is used to quickly determine the status and degree of injury of a trauma victim to the head. The Glasgow Coma Scale is the most widely used scoring system used in quantifying level of consciousness following traumatic brain injury. It is used primarily because it is simple, has a relatively high degree of interobserver reliability and because it correlates well with outcome following severe brain injury.<p>It is easy to use, particularly if a form is used with a table similar to the one above. One determines the best eye opening response, the best verbal response, and the best motor response. The score represents the sum of the numeric scores of each of the categories. There are limitations to its use. If the patient has an endotracheal tube in place, they cannot talk. For this reason, many prefer to document the score by its individual components; so a patient with a Glasgow Coma Score of 15 would be documented as follows: E4 V5 M6. An intubated patient would be scored as E4 Vintubated M6. Of these individual factors, the best motor response is probably the most significant.</p><p>Other factors which alter the patients level of consciousness interfere with the scale's ability to acurately reflect the severity of a traumatic brain injury. So, shock, hypoxemia, drug use, alcohol intoxication, metabolic disturbances may alter the GCS independently of the brain injury. Obviously, a patient with a spinal cord injury will make the motor scale invalid, and severe orbital trauma may make eye opening impossible to assess. The GCS also has limited utility in children, particularly those less than 36 months. In spite of these limitations, it is quite useful and is far and away the most widely used scoring system used today to assess patients with traumatic brain injury.</p><br><table><tr><th>Eye Opening (E)</th><th>Verbal Response (V)</th><th>Motor Response (M)</th></tr><tr valign="top"><td>4 = Spontaneous<br>3 = To voice<br>2 = To pain<br>1 = None</td><td>5 = Normal conversation<br>4 = Disoriented conversation<br>3 = Words, but not coherent<br>2 = No words... only sounds<br>1 = None</td><td>6 = Normal<br>5 = Localizes to pain<br>4 = Withdraws to pain<br>3 = Decorticate posture<br>2 = Decerebrate<br>1 = None</td></tr><tr><td colspan=2></td><td>Total = E+V+M</td></tr></table></p>

<p><b>Dopamine : </b>An inhibitor dampening activity so we stay rooted. Travels along pathways into the brain. Plays different roles : Dopamine in the basil ganglia (in brains interior) show they are critical for executing smooth and controlled movements. Lack of dopamine is a cause of parkinson disease which a person looses the ability to initiate controlled movements. Dopamine moves into frontal lobe regulating flow of information coming in from other areas of the brain. Compromise in the flow of dopamine may cause disrupted or incoherent thought as in schizophrenia. In milder disorders, too much dopamine in the limbic system and not enough in the cortex may produce an overly suspicious personality giving to bouts of paranoia or may inhibit social interaction. A shortage of Dopamine in the frontal lobes may contribute to poor working memory. Dopamine is also thought to produce feelings of bliss (the pleasure chemical).

<p><b>Emotional Lability : </b>Exhibiting rapid and drastic changes in emotional state (laughing, crying, anger) inappropriately without apparent reason.</p>
<p><b>Endorphins : </b>Neurochemicals which mediate pain at receptor sites. In an injury receptors in skin make electrical signals that goes up the spinal cord to the brain. The brain then evaluates pain by releasing pain killers called endorphins which bind at opiate receptor sites of neurons to mediate pain. Endorphins effect the dopamine pathway that feeds into the frontal lobe. These pathways inhibit the flow of dopamine. Vast quantities of endorphins are released and nerves are shut off so more dopamine flows through pathway to get to frontal lobe therefore replacing pain with pleasure.</p>

It may be associated with loss of consciousness, loss of bowel and bladder control and tremors. May also cause aggression or other behavioral change.</p>
<p><b>Sensation : </b>Feeling stimuli which activate sensory organs of the body, such as touch, temperature, pressure and pain. Also seeing, hearing, smelling and tasting.</p>
<p><b>Sensorimotor : </b>Refers to all aspects of movement and sensation and the interaction of the two.</p>
<p><b>Sensory Depravation : </b>Serotonin system is effected through means of fasting and other related activities. The levels of serotonin in the thalamus are shifted causing the thalamus to loose some of its ability to control the flow of information coming in from the senses.</p>

<p><b>Sequencing : </b>Reading, listening, expressing thoughts, describing events or contracting muscles in an orderly and meaningful manner.</p>
<p><b>Serotonin : </b>A chemical, 5-hydrozytryptamine (5-HT), present in blood platelets, the gastrointestinal tract, and certain regions of the brain. It plays an important role in blood clotting, stimulating a strong heart beat, initiating sleep, fighting depression (prescription drugs that treat depression raise the brain's levels of serotonin) and causing migraine headaches in susceptible individuals (because of its ability to constrict blood vessels or cause them to spasm). Serotonin is synthesized from the amino acid L-tryptophan. Serotonin (and, therefore, L-tyrptophan) also serves as a precursor for the pineal hormone melatonin, which regulates the body's clock.</p>
<p><b>Sheltered Workshop : </b>A work setting certified as such by the Wage & Hour Division.

Characteristics may include increase in deep tendon reflexes, resistance to passive stretch, clasp knife phenomenon, and clonus.</p>
<p><b>Spatial Ability : </b>Ability to perceive the construction of an object in both two and three dimensions. Spatial ability has four components : the ability to perceive a static figure in different positions, the ability to interpret and duplicate the movements between various parts of a figure, the ability to perceive the relationship between an object and a person's own body sphere, and the ability to interpret the person's body as an object in space.</p>
<p><b>Speech-language Pathology Services : </b>A continuum of services including prevention, identification, diagnosis, consultation and treatment of patients regarding speech, language, oral and pharyngeal sensorimotor function.</p>
<p><b>Spontaneous Recovery : </b>The recovery which occurs as damage to body tissues heals. This type of recovery occurs with or without rehabilitation and it is very difficult to know how much improvement is spontaneous and how much is due to rehabilitative interventions. However, when the recovery is guided by an experienced rehabilitation team, complications can be anticipated and minimized; the return of function can be channeled in useful directions and in progressive steps so that the eventual outcome is the best that is possible.</p>
<p><b>Substance P : </b>An 11-amino acid peptide that is believed to be important as a neurotransmitter in the pain fiber system. This substance may also be important in eliciting local tissue reactions resembling inflammation.</p>
<p><b>Supine : </b>Lying on one's back.</p>
<p><b>Suppository : </b>Medicine contained in a capsule which is inserted into the rectum so that the medicine can be absorbed into the blood stream.</p>
<p><b>Synapse : </b>The point of junction between two neurons in a neural pathway, where the termination of the axon of one neuron comes into close proximity with the cell body or dendrites of another. At this point, where the relationship of the two neurons is one of contact only, the impulse traveling in the first neuron initiates an impulse in the second neuron. Synapses are polarized, i.e., the impulses pass in one direction only. They are susceptible to fatigue, offer a resistance to the passage of impulses, and are markedly susceptible to the effects of oxygen deficiency, anesthetics, and other agents, including therapeutic drugs and toxic chemicals.</p>

<p><b>Tactile Defensiveness : </b>Being overly sensitive to touch; withdrawing, crying, yelling or striking when one is touched.</p>
<p><b>Task Analysis : </b>Breakdown of a particular job into its component parts; information gained from task analysis can be utilized to develop training curricula or to price a product or service.</p>
<p><b>Temporal Lobes : </b>There are two temporal lobes, one on each side of the brain located at about the level of the ears. These lobes allow a person to tell one smell from another and one sound from another. They also help in sorting new information and are believed to be responsible for short-term memory.<br>- Right Lobe : mainly involved in visual memory (i.e., memory for pictures and faces).<br>- Left Lobe : mainly involved in verbal memory (i.e., memory for words and names).</p>
<p><b>Thalamus : </b>A large ovoid mass of gray matter at the base of the brain, the chief center for transmission of sensory impulses to the cerebral cortex.</p>
<p><b>Tracking, Visual : </b>Visually following an object as it moves through space.</p>
<p><b>Tremor, Intention : </b>Course, rhythmical movements of a body part that become intensified the harder one tries to control them.</p>
<p><b>Tremor, Resting : </b>Rhythmical movements present at rest and may be diminished during voluntary movement.</p>

<h3><a id="A4">A</a></h3>
<p><b>Abortive Infection : </b>When a virus infects a cell (or host), but cannot complete the full replication cycle, i.e. a non-productive infection.</p>
<p><b>Acute Infection : </b>Relatively brief infections, i.e. a few days to a few weeks, following which the virus is usually eliminated completely from the body by the immune system.</p>
<p><b>Arboviruses : </b>A large a diverse group of viruses, taxonomically unrelated which are classically transmitted by arthropod vectors, e.g. mosquitoes, ticks, etc.</p>
<p><b>Assembly : </b>The stage of replication during which all the structural components come together at one site in the cell and the basic structure of the virus particle is formed.</p>
<p><b>Attachment : </b>The binding of a virus particle to a specific receptor on the surface of a host cell.</p>
<h3><a id="C4">C</a></h3>
<p><b>Capsid : </b>A protein shell comprising the main structural unit of a virus particle.</p>
<p><b>Chronic Infection : </b>The converse of acute infections, i.e. prolonged and stubborn. Caused by viruses which are able to persist in the body.</p>
<p><b>Complement fixation (CF) : </b>An assay for detecting the presence of antibodies reactive against a particular antigen, e.g. a virus.</p>
<h3><a id="E4">E</a></h3>
<p><b>Envelope : </b>A lipid membrane enveloping a virus particle.</p>
<h3><a id="F4">F</a></h3>
<p><b>Fusion Protein : </b>The protein(s) on the surface of a virus particle responsible for fusion of the virus envelope with cellular membranes.</p>
<h3><a id="G4">G</a></h3>
<p><b>Gene expression : </b>An important stage of viral replication at which virus genetic information is expressed : one of the major control points in replication.</p>
<p><b>Genome replication : </b>The stage of viral replication at which the virus genome is copied to form new progeny genomes.</p>
<h3><a id="H4">H</a></h3>
<p><b>Haemagglutination-inhibition : </b>An assay used for certain types of viruses which are able to agglutinate red blood cells. Haemagglutination-inhibition records blocking of this process by antibodies, and thus, the presence of antibodies against the virus.</p>
<h3><a id="L4">L</a></h3>
<p><b>Latent Infection : </b>Viruses which are able to down-regulate their gene expression can establish a truly latent state, i.e. with strictly limited gene expression and without ongoing virus replication. Latent virus infections typically persist for the entire life of the host.</p>
<h3><a id="M4">M</a></h3>
<p><b>Minus-sense RNA : </b>A virus with a single-stranded RNA genome of the opposite polarity (&quot;sense&quot;) as mRNA.</p>
<p><b>Matrix Protein : </b>A structural protein of a virus particle which underlies the envelope and links it to the core.</p>
<p><b>Maturation : </b>The stage of viral replication at which a virus particle becomes infectious.</p>
<p><b>Molecular epidemiology : </b>The use of nucleotide sequence information to study the diversity and distribution of virus populations.</p>
<p><b>mRNA : </b>Messenger RNA, translated on ribosomes to produce proteins.</p>
<h3><a id="N4">N</a></h3>
<p><b>Neutralization : </b>Blocking of virus infection by antibodies; also, an assay which measures this.</p>
<p><b>Nucleocapsid : </b>The core of a virus particle consisting of the genome plus a complex of proteins.</p>
<h3><a id="P4">P</a></h3>
<p><b>Plus-sense RNA : </b>A virus with a single-stranded RNA genome of the same polarity (&quot;sense&quot;) as mRNA.</p>
<p><b>Penetration : </b>The stage of viral replication at which the virus genome enters the cell.</p>
<p><b>Persistent Infection : </b>Infections in which ongoing virus replication occurs, but the virus adjusts its replication and pathogenicity so as to avoid killing host. They differ from chronic infections in that whereas in chronic infections, the virus is usually eventually cleared by the host (unless the infection proves fatal), in persistent infections, the virus may continue to be present and to replicate in the host for its entire lifetime.</p>
<p><b>Polyprotein : </b>A long polypeptide encoding several mature proteins which are subsequently released by protease cleavage.</p>
<h3><a id="R4">R</a></h3>
<p><b>Receptor (biochemistry) : </b>A specific molecule on the surface of a cell which is used by a virus for attachment.</p>
<p><b>Release : </b>The stage of viral replication at which virus particles escape the infected cell.</p>
<h3><a id="T4">T</a></h3>
<p><b>Tropism : </b>The ability of a virus to infect specific cell or tissue types.</p>
<h3><a id="U4">U</a></h3>
<p><b>Uncoating : </b>The stage of viral replication at which structural proteins are lost and the virus genome is exposed to the replication machinery.</p>
<h3><a id="V4">V</a></h3>
<p><b>Vector : </b>An organism responsible for transmitting a pathogen from one host to another, e.g. a mosquito. In molecular biology, a molecule used to clone nucleic acid sequences.</p>
<p><b>Virions : </b>Structurally mature, extracellular virus particles.</p>
<p><b>Virus attachment protein : </b>The protein on the surface of a virus particle responsible for binding the receptor.</p>
