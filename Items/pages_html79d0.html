<h2>COMBAT RULES</h2>
<h3>Rounds & Turn Order</h3>
<p>Combat is divided up into rounds, each representing 3.3 seconds. Every round, each player gets to do something. The order of the round is based on an initiative roll of 1D10 plus the players REF stat + the players Initiative Skill, with highest rolls moving first to lowest rolls moving last. Anything that boosts a character's REF or Initiative is added to this roll where applicable. Initiative is rolled at the start of every combat, determining order of player actions, and lasts until the end of combat.</p>
<center><b>INITIATIVE = ROLL 1D10 + REF + INITIATIVE SKILL<br>
HIGH ROLL FIRST</b></center><p><b>Example :</b> Players A, B and C all have REF stats of 10. A rolls a 5, B rolls an 8, and C rolls a 2. Turn order will be B, A, then C.</p>
<h3>Wait for Your Turn</h3>
<p>You can elect to act later in the round, stepping in at any point to act. If you have elected to wait until another player's turn has come up, you will be able to act after they have taken their turn in the round. Characters may reposition their place in Initiative order by holding action. If they do decide to hold action but do nothing with their turn, they default to last place in Initiative order.</p>
<p><b>Example :</b> Turn order is player A, then B, then C. Player A decides to wait until player C has moved from cover, then take his shot. By waiting, the new turn order will be B, C then A.</p>
<h3>Actions</h3>
During your part of the round, you may perform one of the following actions without penalty :<ul>
<li>Move up to your full Movement (3x your Movement Allowance in meters) per round. Actions (such as reloading, defending or Combat Actions) made during the full movement are possible, but incur a -3 penalty. Or you may move up to 1m and perform any other action.</li>
<li>Reload or change weapons.</li>
<li>Mount or dismount from a vehicle. Or stand from a prone position. Making an additional action (reloading, defending or Combat Actions) is possible, but any action made will incur a -3 penalty.</li>
<li>Escape a hold or trap.</li>
<li>Aim (gaining +1 to hit every round of aiming up to 3 rounds).</li>
<li>Perform a non-combat task.</li>
<li>Make your maximum allowable number of Combat Actions.</li>
</ul>
<b>Dodge or Block a melee attack :</b> everyone gets one free dodge per round, after that any Dodges/Blocks are considered part of their Combat Actions.<h3>Combat Actions</h3>
When applying this rule be sure to use discretion, common sense will tell you if what a character is attempting is feasible.<p><b>A)</b> Add your Initiative skill + Combat Sense + any other Initiative modifiers applicable, the final result is known as the Reaction Total (RT). Add your RT to your Applicable Combat Skill (Handgun, Submachine Gun, Rifle, Heavy Weapons, Archery, Martial Arts, and Brawling/Melee) to determine your maximum number of Combat Actions (CA) allowed in a round with that skill.<br>
There are 3 types of CA's, Quick, Normal, and Full. To determine the number of actions allowed by each type, consult the following.</p>
<p><b>Quick Combat Actions (RT+Skill divided by 5) :</b> Firing a semiautomatic weapon (Handgun, Submachine Gun, Rifle, Heavy Weapons), Punches, Striking with Light melee weapons, and Block/Parries, Dodges.</p>
<p><b>Normal Combat Actions (RT+Skill divided by 10) :</b> Nock and fire an Arrow on a Bow, fire a 3-round burst, fire and re-chamber a Pump, Bolt, Lever, or Single Action weapon, Kicks, Casts, Sweeps, Disarms, Escapes, Grapples, Holds, Breaks, Throws and Striking with a Medium melee weapon, Fast Draw a weapon (-4 to hit).</p>
<p><b>Full Combat Actions (RT+Skill divided by 15) :</b> Single Shot or Fully Automatic Weapons, Choke, Crush, Ram and Striking with Heavy melee weapons, draw a weapon.</p>
<p><b>B)</b> The player must specify the number of shots or maneuvers to be performed before the first dice (after initiative) is rolled.</p>
<p><b>C)</b> If attacking more than one target regardless of your RT, you lose a Quick Action, this effect is cumulative. In Close Quarters situations, using any weapon with a Conceilability rating of N, you lose a Normal action (2 quick actions) every time you change targets.</p>
<p><b>D)</b> Regardless of RT or Skill level, only a character's first shot can be a Called Shot per round. This rule also applies to martial arts and melee attacks but only within normal striking range. More than 5 feet of movement limits a character to 1 Martial Art attack per round. (For example if a character has to close distance, or wants to perform a running attack, he only gets the 1 attack).</p>
<p><b>E)</b> After the first combat action, all following Combat Actions allowed take a cumulative -1. Combat Actions taken beyond those allowed by your RT acquire a -3 cumulative penalty, on top of the penalty already acquired. The maximum number of additional Combat Actions is x2 what is allowed.</p>
<p><b>F)</b> If the weapons BODY minimum is higher than the characters BODY, divide the number of Combat Actions allowed by Half (rounding down).</p>
<p><b>G)</b> Different types of Combat Actions may be performed. A full Combat Action = 1 Normal CA and 1 Quick CA, or 3 Quick CA's. A Normal CA = 2 Quick CA's. A character may even use 2 separate skills to perform multiple Combat Actions, however the RT is determined by the LOWEST skill being used.</p>
