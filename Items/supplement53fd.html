		<h4>Review</h4>
		<p>Successor to Corporation Report vol 1, this time it is Militech and Lazarus, two para-military corporations, who are under the microscope. As in the first volume, there are a lot of details about the troops and their armament, but here it is all the more justified since the corporations studied are military corporations. Nothing new, the supplement is exactly the same as the previous one in terms of overall quality, rather good on the whole. The context is very much focused on military, para-military and police aspects.</p>
