<p><span class="r">Overview:</span> Even of Destruction, one of the myriad of "B" terminator imitator movies, is about a military project gone bad (Gee, that's original!). In this case, they've developed an incredibly realistic android who can mimic humans. In addition to some very sophisticated fake cyborg exoskeleton stuff (similar to Terminator), they've embedded the android called "Eve" with memories from its creator, Dr. Eve Simmons (Renée Soutendijk). Eve can blend in, but also has incredible strength, terrific armor, great fighting skills, and also has a thermonuclear warhead embedded inside her body. Unfortunately, during "trial runs" while walking around the bay area, she accidentally gets shot during a bank heist.</p>

<p>The shooting ends up messing up her memory and programming, and after killing the bank robber, she takes his guns and leaves. To stop her, the military brings in its top man, Gregory Hines, a special forces cop type. Hines has to work with Eve's creator, Dr. Simmons to stop this android before it blows up a bunch of city blocks.</p>

<p><span class="r">The Bottom Line:</span> While Gregory Hines puts in his usual decent performance, Renée Soutendijk as the scientist babe (and crazed android) puts in a pretty good performance as well, there are enough story issues to take away full enjoyment of this flick. This is even more problematic considering there is very little original here - you think they'd be able to get this right! Extra star added for acting well above the quality of the script, but not enough to make this good.</p></div>
