		<h4>Review</h4>
		<p>Like Home Front, this scenario deals with a serious subject : rape. Against a backdrop of revenge, players will have to investigate virtual recreation centers and a series of murders. Some vampires are also present, they should not have been forgotten. All in all, a well-crafted scenario, set in a rather interesting context, but which will not please everyone, due to its tragic nature. Alternate Reality supplements such as Dark Metropolis, Night's Edge and Grimm's Cybertales are recommended to complete this scenario.</p>
