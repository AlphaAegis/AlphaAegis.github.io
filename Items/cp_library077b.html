<h1>William Gibson</h1>

<blockquote><p><i>Gibson's view of a very probable downside future was a satirical criticism of current trends. Somehow, it touched a nerve and triggered a cascade of intelligent inquiry and practical experimentation. There's no end of discussion -- which ranges from literary to practical to psychological -- about the implications of our new found powers. The fact is that we are building another reality.</i><br>
-- Henry W.Targowski</p>

<p>William Gibson is an American science fiction author living in Vancouver, Canada. He was born near Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, USA, in 1948. Gibson is married with Deborah Gibson, and they have 2 children.</p>
<p>Gibson has been writing short stories since the 70's, and he had a few vague ideas as early as 1976, the year he wrote his first published story <i>Fragments of a Hologram Rose</i>, which mixes end-of-an-affair melancholy with an early take on virtual reality. But it wasn't quite working, so he gave up and spent 1977 buying punk 45s.</p>
<p>Gibson's first novel, <i>Neuromancer</i>, appeared in 1984. <i>Neuromancer</i> very soon gained a cult status by being one of the first novels in a new science-fiction genre called Cyberpunk.</p>
<p>Gibson is the coiner of the word &quot;cyberspace&quot;. He used it for the first time in his story <i>Burning Chrome</i> in 1982.</p>
<p>The cyberpunk literature of the eighties had a very pessimistic view of the future, predicting the rise of multinational capitalistic corporations, and showing the negative effects the forthcoming new technologies may have on everyday human life. Although it has been said that cyberpunk as a literary genre is already dead, the ideas William Gibson presented in his novels are now appearing in many other contexts - both artistic, sociological and technical.</p>
<p>Gibson has written the X-Files episodes <a href="cp_media84fb.html?id_media=179&amp;lng=us">Kill Switch</a> (1998) and <a href="cp_media5052.html?id_media=189&amp;lng=us">First Person Shooter</a> (2000) with Tom Maddox.</p>
