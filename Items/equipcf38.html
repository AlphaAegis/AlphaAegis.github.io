<h2>EQUIPMENT FOR FIREARMS AND BOWS</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>EQUIPMENT AND MODIFICATIONS FOR FIREARMS</h3>
<p><a name="e39">25 mm grenade attachment</a> <b>$200</b><br>This pistol attachment goes on the end of the barrel and allows the pistol to fire special 25 mm pistol grenades using a bullet-trap mechanism.</p>
<p><a name="e77">911 ChipLink</a> <b>$150 + $25 installation (<i>Average WeaponSmith, 15 minutes</i>)</b><br>Installed with a hook-up to the trigger system of your gun, this is effectively a mini cell-phone that pages the police when your trigger is pulled. Local law enforcement will usually respond to your page within 2d6+1 minutes, as long as you are not in a very high risk environment (such as the combat zone).</p>
<p><a name="e41">Bayonet lug</a> <b>5% of weapon cost (<i>Routine WeaponSmith, 5 minutes</i>)</b><br>Bayonet Lugs are mounted under the barrel of a rifle to accept a bayonet (a long, pointed knife), thus turning the firearm into an improvised spear. The use of bayonet lugs has been reduced due to the popularity of under-barrel weapon systems such as grenade launchers in warfare and the use of flashlights for tactical and house-to-house use.</p>
<p><a name="e42">Bipod</a> <b>$20</b><br>This bipod attaches to the barrel of most assault rifles and heavy weapons and allows you to fire while lying down. The accuracy bonus is +2 at medium, long and extreme range if the weapon rests on a fixed base.</p>
<p><a name="e43">Brass-catcher</a> <b>10% of weapon cost (<i>Routine WeaponSmith, 5 minutes</i>)</b><br>Brass Catchers are special bags designed with a customized metal framework to fit over the ejection port of a weapon to receive the spent cartidges. Rarely seen now in an era of caseless weaponry, brass-catchers are still found on assassination and para-drop weaponry when the fighting environment must be left &quot;sterile&quot; (without trace of the assassin or the para-drop). A typical brass-catcher can hold two magazines of ejected casings, but reduces weapon concealability one class.</p>
<p><a name="e44">Camouflaged SMG</a> <b>50% of weapon cost (<i>Difficult Basic Tech, 2-3 hours</i>)</b><br>This system conceals a submachine gun inside an innocuous-looking briefcase. A switch on the handle drops the bulk of the briefcase off revealing the SMG with two attached clips of ammunition. The case itself is armored to SP 10 for use as a sort of last ditch effort shield.</p>
<p><a name="e142">Choke</a> <b>$50 (<i>Average WeaponSmith, 10 minutes</i>)</b><br>A choke is a modification reserved for smoothbore rifles. The narrowing of the muzzle of a barrel reduces the dispersion of the leads. This modification directly influences the accuracy and power of the weapon. There are 4 classes of choke, but intermediate versions can be specially machined.<br>- Cylinder : 40% of leads / +1 damage, - 1 accuracy<br>- Improved cylinder : 50% of leads / +2 damage, - 2 accuracy<br>- Modified : 60% of leads / +3 damage, -3 accuracy<br>- Full : 70% of leads / +4 damage, -4 accuracy</p>
<p><a name="e47">Chopped barrel</a> <b>30% of weapon cost (<i>Average WeaponSmith, 10 (rifle) to 45 minutes</i>)</b><br>Practically only full-length rifles and shotguns can have their barrels chopped, as most other weapons in 2020 have already been optimized for minimum barrel length. Chopping a barel increases the concealability of the firearm by one class, and reduces the range by half also. Shotgun patterns are increased by 50%, and pistol and SMG WA is penalized 1 point.</p>
<p><a name="e91">Computer-assisted aiming</a> <b>$500</b><br>This electronic sighting system adds +3 to the chances of hitting at long and extreme range, and +2 at medium range. It includes low-light vision, and for an additional $200 allows sighting by heat detector (infrared). The size of this equipment reserves it for rifles and heavy weapons.</p>
<p><a name="e51">Cookie Cutter</a> <b>$300 plus Cookie Cutter badges</b><br>This attachment keeps the gun from firing when aimed at a person wearing a special cookie-cutter badge attuned to the gun. This allows for suppressive fire through a group of your friends, confident in knowing that you will not be tagging any of them by accident.</p>
<p><a name="e80">Cooling shroud</a> <b>25% of weapon cost (<i>Average WeaponSmith, 5 minutes</i>)</b><br>This shroud keeps the weapon barrel cool allowing non-support weapons to fire on full-auto for consecutive rounds without loss of reliability. Unfortunately shrouds are fairly bulky and reduce concealability by 1.</p>
<p><a name="e54">Custom finish</a> <b>$30 to $500</b><br>The most diverse paints and coatings are in vogue at the moment : natural colours, glazing, camouflage, fading, pearlescent, phosphorescent, chrome...</p>
<p><a name="e53">Custom long-arm grips and furniture</a> <b>60% of rifle or shotgun cost (<i>Difficult WeaponSmith, 2 hours, 20 rounds of ammo</i>)</b><br>Serving the same purpose to a long arm as Custom Pistol Grips do to a pistol, these custom grips are paired with adjustable cheek-rest and butt-stock, allowing for more comfortable use and aiming, and increasing the maximum aim-time from 3 rounds (+3) to 4 rounds (+4). Anyone else using the weapon will be at -1WA unless they re-set the stock and cheek-rest (30 seconds).</p>
<p><a name="e73">Custom pistol grips</a> <b>$100 (<i>Difficult WeaponSmith, 40 minutes</i>)</b><br>Custom grips on a handgun allow for increased draw accuracy, as the weapon seems to mold itself to your hand and practically begs to be fired. Each set of grips has to be custom molded to the individual, and must be replaced annually. While being used by the person they were designed for, custom grips reduce the fastdraw and snapshot penalties from -3 WA to -2 WA.</p>
<p><a name="e92">Cyber-optic targeting</a> <b>$250 (<i>smartlink required</i>)</b><br>This advanced sighting system projects a reticle onto the cyber-optics, and makes what the shooter is aiming coincide with the weapon's sensors. The accuracy bonus is +1, in addition to the bonus given by the smartlink.</p>
<p><a name="e90">Cyber-optic triangulation</a> <b>$4000</b><br>This system requires an interface socket and cyber optics. It allows to visualize the place where the weapon points, to zoom for long distance shooting (teleoptic option required). The accuracy bonus is +3 at all distances (including the shooting interface and scope bonus). Malus due to moving targets is reduced by 2 points.<br>Also, the COT system allows you to shoot &quot;around corners&quot;, using the camera integrated into the weapon to aim, and keeping your head safe. This mode allows shooting with a bonus of +2. This system is only reliable on quality weapons (at least +1 in accuracy). Its main disadvantage is its relative fragility. To be reserved for snipers.</p>
<p><a name="e62">Digital interface for smartlink</a> <b>$500</b><br>Controls the status of the smartgun, and sends the data to a TimeSquare display. These include the number of shots fired, the temperature of the barrel and the general state of the weapon's mechanisms. +2 in TECH to jam-clearing the weapon.</p>
<p><a name="e40">Electrothermal ammunition enhancement</a> <b>150% of weapon price (<i>Very Difficult WeaponSmith, 5 hours</i>)</b><br>Only available to cased semi-automatic and manual weapons, this system changes the entire firing system to use a combustable fluid in the munitions that is set off with an electric charge producing a very rapid-expanding plasma to propel the munition. The result is a 50% increase in damage and range with no significant increase in recoil. The weapon must also use special ElectroThermic munitions which cost twice the normal price of ammo.</p>
<p><a name="e46">Extended barrel</a> <b>30% of weapon cost (<i>Average WeaponSmith, 10 minutes</i>)</b><br>Increasing barrel length also increases projectile stability, and thus increases the accurate range of a weapon. Concelability is penalized one class, and range is increased by 25%.</p>
<p><a name="e52">Folding stock</a> <b>20% of weapon cost (<i>Average WeaponSmith, 1 hour</i>)</b><br>This includes folding, detachable and collapsing stock designs. On weapons normally equipped with a stock, a folding stock reduces WA by 1 (2 when collapsed) and increases concealability by one class when collapsed. On weapons not normally equipped with a stock, the stock provides +1 WA at Long and Extreme ranges.</p>
<p><a name="e48">Gas venting</a> <b>$200 to $400 (<i>Difficult WeaponSmith, 2 hours</i>)</b><br>Through the use of gas vents, ports, muzzle brakes, recoil-dampening materials and construction and so on, semi-automatic weapons with rates of fire of 1 or 2 can have their rate of fire increased by 1.</p>
<p><a name="e63">Grenade launcher for rifles and submachine guns</a> <br>These devices can be installed under the barrel of most conventional assault rifles, and on some heavy submachine guns.<blockquote><b>M-205</b><br>Price :<b> $250</b><br>HeavyWeapons skill<br>Accuracy : +1<br>Availability : poor<br>Magazine : 1<br>Cartridge : 40 mm grenade<br> Rate of fire : 1<br>Range : 200 meters<br><br><b>Militech Pump Action Mini Launcher</b><br>Price :<b> $255</b><br>HeavyWeapons skill<br>Accuracy : -1<br>Availability : common<br>Magazine : 4<br>Cartridge : 40 mm grenade<br>Rate of fire : 2<br>Range : 200 meters</blockquote></p>
<p><a name="e57">Gun-Cam</a> <b>$100</b><br>This device, already mandatory in some states on registered weapons, consists of a camera attached to the end of the barrel, which takes up to ten shots that can be transferred to the target's computer at the time of firing. Useful to prove a state of self-defense.</p>
<p><a name="e60">HV adaptation</a> <b>400% of weapon cost</b><br>Adapting a weapon to fire HV ammo is an involved process and is not usually a financially viable after-market mod. The barrel must be replaced with a stronger, heat-resistant model, the bolt must be made significantly heavier and some amount of shock-absorbancy should be added. Weapons with HV ammo Adaptation still get -1 REL when firing HV ammo, but do not receive the Reliability penalty for full autofire.</p>
<p><a name="e58">Heat-resistant barrel</a> <b>50% of weapon cost (<i>Average WeaponSmith, 40 minutes</i>)</b><br>This after-market barrel upgrade to a polymer-ceramic alloy allows for non-support weapons to fire on full auto for multiple consecutive rounds without reduction in reliability.</p>
<p><a name="e59">Heavy bolt</a> <b>15% of weapon cost (<i>Difficult Weaponsmith Roll, 2 hours</i>)</b><br>A heavier bolt decreases the ROF in non-caseless full auto weapons by 10. If this decreases the ROF below 20, the firearm will fail to cycle. This reduction in ROF increases the weapon's controleability during autofire providing +1 WA during autofire only.</p>
<p><a name="e68">High-capacity magazine</a> <b>$20 to $50</b><br>For all types of weapons. A high-capacity magazine allows you to increase the capacity of a conventional magazine at will. The disadvantages are the increased size of the weapon (decrease in concealability), and sometimes decrease in reliability, due to overheating. At the discretion of the GM.</p>
<p><a name="e61">Hydroshock adaptor</a> <b>$200 (<i>Difficult WeaponSmith, 1 hour</i>)</b><br>This retuning of a gun allows it to fire HydroShock munitions without a reliability penalty.</p>
<p><a name="e137">Increase the length of the barrel</a> <b>25% of weapon cost (<i>Very Difficult WeaponSmith, 8 hours</i>)</b><br>This definitive extension of the barrel length improves the accuracy of any type of weapon with an unshortened barrel. Indeed, a longer barrel will increase the gyroscopic stabilization effect of the projectile and decrease the final and not the useful range (which will be increased in the same way as accuracy and for the same reasons). The accuracy is therefore increased by one point while the concealment is reduced by one class.<br>It's a difficult and delicate job and it will be much easier to buy a longer barrel (15% of the base price of the weapon), if the manufacturer sells it.</p>
<p><a name="e45">Interchangeable barrel / bolt carrier</a> <b>$100 to $300</b><br>You can install those kits yourself on your weapon, they allow you to adapt it to ammunition for which it was not made. According to the result of the Gentech roll, the GM can give malus to the weapon's accuracy, range, and reliability.</p>
<p><a name="e93">Laser sight</a> <b>$200 à $350</b><br>Laser sighting systems allow for rapid locking and acquisition of targets in firefight situations, providing +1 WA when in use.</p>
<p><a name="e66">Light bolt</a> <b>15% of firearm cost (<i>Difficult Weaponsmith Roll, 2 hours</i>)</b><br>By decreasing the weight of the bolt in non-caseless autofire weapons, the ROF can be increased by 10, although reliability is decreased by 1 class.</p>
<p><a name="e64">Mini-missile launcher for rifles</a> <br>This support weapon located under the barrel of a rifle fires a mini-missile with an IR homing head, which follows the target once it has been acquired. Shooting at +2 without taking into account cover modifiers. If it fails, the missile can correct its trajectory 40% of the time and attempt a new attack. In another case, it continues its race to another target.<br>Damage : 4D6 AP, or HEP type 4D6+4 (armor ineffective, semi-real damage). <b>$75</b><blockquote><b>Launcher</b><br>Price : $900<br>Accuracy : +2<br>Availability : poor<br>Magazine : 4<br>Rate of fire : 2<br>Reliability : unreliable<br>Range : 200 meters</blockquote></p>
<p><a name="e67">Optical scope (2x, 4x and 6x)</a> <b>$300 and up</b><br>Optical sighting systems double the aiming bonus to +2 per turn instead of +1 at Medium, Long and Extreme ranges, and can be equipped with standard cyberoptic options at 80% of normal price.</p>
<p><a name="e70">Page ChipLink</a> <b>$200 + $25 installation (<i>Average WeaponSmith, 15 minutes</i>)</b><br>The exact same technology as the 911 ChipLink, PageChipping is sold through independant retailers and weaponsmiths and can be set to page any number, not just the local 911.</p>
<p><a name="e71">Phase IV IR/UV Laser Sight</a> <b>$250</b><br>Identical to the standard laser sighting systems, Phase IV systems emit either IR or UV light instead of visible red light. To use one requires a visual device with either passive IR or UV options.</p>
<p><a name="e74">Precision re-boring</a> <br>With top-of-the-line equipment and a good gunsmith, the accuracy of most firearms can be increased by re-boring and re-working the barrel and receiver unit. This cannot be done on Electrothermic weapons, shotguns and polymer weapons (smoothbores). Weapon Accuracy can be increased by up to +2 in this way, but with such a fine-tuned weapon, barrel degredation occurs rapidly when actually used. There is a 20% chance of barrel degredation (-1 WA, until down to normal WA) per :<br>* 40 small-caliber rounds fired<br>* 20 medium-caliber rounds fired<br>* 10 heavy-caliber rounds fired<br>* ½ this number if hot-loaded ammo is being used<br>* 1/10 this number if HV ammo is being used<br><br><b><i>dif 20 gunsmith roll, 6 hours, +1 WA (aprox value=75% of gun cost)<br>dif 30 gunsmith roll, 9 hours, additional +1 WA (aprox value=200% of gun cost)<br>(+5 difficulty, x2 cost for revolvers)</i></b></p>
<p><a name="e75">Printless finish</a> <b>200% of weapon cost</b><br>This teflon parkerized finish resists dirt and oil so well that it actually makes it nearly impossible to lift a set of prints off the weapon, even after extended use under optimal conditions.</p>
<p><a name="e72">Quality increase</a> <b>50% of weapon cost per +1 Reliability</b><br>The other end of the scale is that some small Auto-Lathes turn out imitations of the cheap polymer guns made with good quality plastics and metals, thus increasing the reliability. Actually any weapon can be purchased with a higher grade of materials or workmanship.</p>
<p><a name="e78">Rapid take-down rebuild</a> <b>20% of weapon cost (<i>Very Difficult WeaponSmith, 6 hours</i>)</b><br>This set of midifications allows a rifle or SMG to be broken down rapidly into three parts for ease of transport (stock, action, barrel). Reliability of the weapon is reduced one class.</p>
<p><a name="e79">Rechambered barrel and receiver group</a> <b>40% of weapon cost (<i>Difficult WeaponSmith, 8 hours</i>)</b><br>A good gunsmith can rechamber most firearms to fire larger or smaller caliber munitions. Reducing the caliber of a firearm will have little effect except a 5-20% increase in ammo capacity (GMs call). Increasing the caliber of a firearm can be done to a slightly larger bore (9 mm to 10 mm) at a -1 WA, and major reboring (10mm to 12mm) will result in a -1 WA and -1 Reliability.</p>
<p><a name="e49">Recoil compensation</a> <b>$200 (<i>Difficult WeaponSmith, 2 hours</i>)</b><br>Through vent ports and muzzle brakes mounted into the barrel of an automatic weapon, muzzle jump and climb can be controlled or eliminated, thus increase WA in autofire modes by 1.</p>
<p><a name="e141">Red dot sight</a> <b>$150</b><br>A red dot sight provides shooting assistance while leaving the field of view clear and sharp. In case of reflex shooting the bonus for accuracy and initiative is +1.</p>
<p><a name="e81">ScanGrips by Techtronica</a> <b>$200 (<i>Difficult WeaponSmith, 1 hour</i>)</b><br>Special memory-plastic grips linked to the safety and electronic sighting devices on your firearm. When you (and only you) grasp you firearm, the grips set themselves to your hand and read your fingerprints, only on a positive match will it disengage the safety and turn on the electronics (can be combined with Custom Grips).</p>
<p><a name="e76">Security chipping</a> <b>$200 + $50 installation (<i>Difficult WeaponSmith, 30 minutes</i>)</b><br>This is a SmartGun add-on that locks the firing pin mechanism until a pre-authorized person interfaces with the weapon (people are checked by the serial numbers of their InterFace Plug firmware). When originally installed the weapon can be chipped for up to 6 different interface combinations. Changing an authorization requires a Routine CyberTech roll by an authorized user, taking 5 minutes. Bypassing the authorizations requires a Very Difficult Electronic Security or CyberTech roll, taking a minute.</p>
<p><a name="e88">Selective fire</a> <b>200% of weapon cost (<i>Difficult WeaponSmith, 30 minutes</i>)</b><br>Any gas-action automatic weapon can be converted to selective fire. This adds a selector switch between single shot, 3 shot burst and full autofire. Full Autofire is at -2WA, and weapon reliability is reduced one level.</p>
<p><a name="e82">Side-saddle ammo holder</a> <b>$65</b><br>This attachment clips onto the side of internal-magazine weapons and holds 6 shells. Commonly used with pump-action shotguns and the ever-popular Boomer Buster, they do seem to add an air of intimidation to a weapon.</p>
<p><a name="e83">Silencer / suppressor</a> <b>$200 + $50 snap-on modification to gun (<i>Difficult WeaponSmith, 20 minutes</i>)</b><br>Designed to muffle the sounds of the gas expansion in a gun as well as the flash produced by said explosion, silencers screw on to the end of the barrel and reduce the concealability of a weapon by 1. Weapons firing sub-sonic munitions (< 9 mm) become almost totally silent, while other weapons just reduce their firing signature, as their bullets still produce small sonic booms in their passage.</p>
<p><a name="e86">SmartLink</a> <b>$200 to $1000</b><br>The SmartLink acquires the target by sonic or laser beam, and triggers the firing at the time of this acquisition, by neural cybernetic link with the shooter. Accuracy bonus : +2 within sensor range. This range varies from 20 meters to 200 meters depending on the model. Virtually all weapons can be equipped with them, except pocket weapons.</p>
<p><a name="e50">SmartLink Controller I.D.D</a> <b>$720</b><br>The weapon can provide information via cyberaudio, and the user can program the weapon to respond to the voice (e. g. remote firing).</p>
<p><a name="e84">SmartPorting</a> <b>60% of gun cost for smartguns, 100% of gun cost for other weapons</b><br>Using a series of servo-controlled gas ports and vents, SmartPorting is linked to the weapon's fire selector and, depending on the gun's setting, provides either +1 WA in full auto fire (5 rounds or greater ROF) or increases the ROF of semi-automatic weapons by 1 (to a maxiumum of 3). SmartPorting is not compatible with Gas Venting or Recoil Compensation.</p>
<p><a name="e55">Solenoid and electric triggers</a> <b>$200 (<i>Average Weaponsmith / Difficult Electronics, 3 hours</i>)</b><br>This mod can only be done on caseless weapons. Weapons with a solenoid trigger must buy special caseless ammo for 90% of the normal cost, and receive +1 WA at extreme range because of the reduced trigger pull.</p>
<p><a name="e85">Speedholster</a> <b>$100</b><br>This is an ejector holster model, attached to the hip, shoulder, leg or back. A sleeve-mounted model for pocket weapons is also available, +1 to initiative if you draw quickly.</p>
<p><a name="e87">Tactical flashlight rig</a> <b>$150 + $50 for IR or UV</b><br>This under-barrel adaptor hooks up to a rifle, shotgun or sub-gun and holds a high-power short flashlight for use in light-deficient situations. Also available with IR and UV flashlights.</p>
<p><a name="e89">Tripod, turret</a> <b>$30 to $200</b><br>Commonly used for heavy weapons, these fixed devices make it possible to fire with a +2 bonus, from a vehicle (in this case, possibly take into account a malus due to tremors) or from the ground.</p>
<p><a name="e65">Under-barrel capacitor laser</a> <b>$950</b><br>This device is mounted under the barrel of an assault rifle or an heavy SMG, or on top of a SMG, and looks like a large laser sight. Its characteristics are :<blockquote>Accuracy : +2<br>Damage : 3D6<br>Availability : rare<br>Magazine : 2<br>Rate of fire : 2<br>Range : 25 meters</blockquote>With an accumulator : 2 additional loads ($150, 2 kg).</p>
<p><a name="e69">Under-barrel microwave</a> <b>$500</b><br>This device is mounted under the barrel of an assault rifle or an heavy SMG, or on top of a SMG, and looks like a large laser sight. Its characteristics are :<blockquote>Accuracy : 0<br>Damage : 1D6<br>Availability : poor<br>Magazine : 4<br>Rate of fire : 2<br>Range : 20 meters</blockquote>With an accumulator : range +5m, 4 additional loads ($250, 4 kg).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>EQUIPMENT AND MODIFICATIONS FOR BOWS</h3>
<p><a name="e94">Automatic crossbow loader</a> <b>25% of weapon cost</b><br>Magazine containing six bolts and an electrical device that automatically tightens the string. Accuracy is reduced by 1 point, but the fire rate is doubled.</p>
<p><a name="e95">Gyro-stabilizer</a> <b>$100</b><br>Halves the penalty due to the shooter's movements during shooting, keeping the bow stable, even while moving.</p>
<p><a name="e96">Optical scope for bows</a> <br>- Optical scope (+1 in accuracy) <b>$50</b><br>- Cyber-optical targeting (+1 in accuracy, requires smartlink) <b>250$</b><br>- Infrared or light amplifiers <b>200$ / 150$</b></p>
<p><a name="e97">String silencer</a> <b>$50</b><br>Set of pads that muffle the &quot;stang&quot; of the loose string, to make it look like a discreet sniffing. Does not exist for crossbows.</p></div>
