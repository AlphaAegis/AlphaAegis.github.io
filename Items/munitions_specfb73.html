<title>Special ammunitions</title></head>
<body>
<div class="c"><h2>SPECIAL AMMUNITIONS</h2>
<p>Special ammunition is generally scarce, and available at gold prices from the best-endowed fixers (ignoring the given prices, which are those on the military market, the black market is much more expensive). With few exceptions, they are illegal.</p>
<br>
<h3>Standard Rounds</h3>
<p><a>Heavy jacket</a> <b>cost x 1.5</b><br>Thick metal jackets on the bullet stop it breaking up in the target, reducing the lethality, but making it more likely to incapacitate. Used by some armies as a more &quot;humane&quot; weapon than a normal ball round, which can break up as it passes through the victim, tearing a bigger wound. The heavy jacket also makes the rounds more effective against light armour. SP is reduced by D6, stun saves -1, death saves +1 (less likely to kill immediately, but causes more shock).</p>
<p><a>Lead Round Nose (LRN)</a> <b>cost x 0.5</b><br>Simple and inexpensive non-jacketed lead bullet with rounded head for better air penetration. This ball brings +1 to accuracy but damage is halved, because the bullet is unlikely to expand.</p>
<p><a>Match grade ammunition</a> <b>cost x 4</b><br>This is ammo hand made for competition shooting or sniping. Each round is made to get the best shot, with stability and accuracy. Weapon WA is +1 on single shot only. This bonus is lost on autofire.</p>
<p><a>Nickel jacketed rounds</a> <b>cost x 1</b><br>These are normal rounds with jackets made of nickel rather than copper. While this does little to the rounds performance, it does have one important effect when shooting at a steel target; It strikes sparks. Normal rounds are designed NOT to spark, as this could be bad if they spark when being loaded. But a purpose made nickel jacket will strike up sparks capable of igniting fuel and vapours, allowing the Hollywood stunt of shooting a cars petrol tank and causing it to explode (with normal rounds the chances are it'd just leak everywhere).</p>
<p><a>Normal ball rounds</a> <b>cost x 1</b><br>These are the standard bullet that all guns fire, a core of soft lead wrapped with a jacket of copper or gilding metal or something similar. They are basically a chunk of soft heavy metal with a stronger metal jacket around them to hold them together as they pass through stuff.</p>
<p><a>Plastic training rounds</a> <b>cost x 0.5</b><br>These are a plastic round with a partial metal jacket, designed for use on ranges. The round is unstable and lightweight, making it safe to use when aiming at a close target, as any misses will fall from the air instead of carrying on and possibly injuring someone off the range They are full damage at point blank and close ranges, but loose 1D6 every range band after SP of armour is doubled.</p>
<p><a>Subsonic</a> <b>cost x 2</b><br>These bullets are very low acoustic signature, as they travel below the speed of sound. This is usually due to an increased bullet weight, giving a slow, heavy round that causes the same damage as a normal round without supersonic &quot;crack&quot;. The bullet breaking the sound barrier is the second loudest part of a gunshot, after the blast at the muzzle itself, so subsonic bullets fired from a silenced weapon are virtually unnoticeable as gunshots. Damage as normal, Armour is x 1.5 as the bullet is slow.</p>
<br>
<h3>Blanks</h3>
<p><a>Crimped blanks</a> <b>cost x 0.5</b><br>These are a normal casing with NO projectile attached, simply loaded with powder and then crimped shut. When fired they simply go BANG. They can be used to fire rifle grenades, and at point blank the blast could cause an injury (and Point blank range ONLY) (damage is calculated by finding the weapons MINIMUM damage, and rolling the closest dice) EG 9 mm is 2D6+1, minimum is 3, so a 9 mm blank does D3 damage at point blank. A round doing 4D6+2 would do D6, and so on. Always take the lower dice, so a minimum of 5 would be D4 not D6. This damage is half STUN only.</p>
<p><a>Wadded blanks</a> <b>cost x 0.5</b><br>These have a plug of wood, wax, plastic or paper over the end of the round, so that when its fired the gases travel up the barrel behind this &quot;plug&quot;, producing enough pressure to operate a gas action. These weapons do very little damage, unless the wadding hits someone (WA -2). Damage is as a normal round, ignoring any plusses and subtracting 4 from EACH DIE (so 9 mm is (D6-4) + (D6-4) rather than 2D6+1). At point the blast itself could cause an injury. This extra damage is calculated by finding the weapons MINIMUM damage, and rolling the closest dice. So 9 mm at PB is (D6-4) + (D6-4) + D3 (9 mm minimum is 2D6+1=3, so D3).</p>
<br>
<h3>Expanding Rounds</h3>
<p><a>&quot;Copper tip&quot; or &quot;Silver tip&quot;</a> <b>cost x 1.5</b><br>These are bullets with soft metal tips to give controlled expansion when they hit the target, the soft tip bending and starting the round expanding and breaking up as it enters the body. This does make then less effective against armour, but having a full bullet shape rather than the hollow in the tip makes them easier for automatics to load (some automatics will jam trying to load hollow-points, as the flat tip doesn't push forwards into the chamber fully). SP x 1.5, Dam x 1.25 after armour.</p>
<p><a>Dum Dums</a> <b>cost x 1.5</b><br>One of the first &quot;specialist&quot; rounds, the Dum Dum design is credited to Captain &quot;Bertie&quot; Clay of the Royal Artillery at the Dum Dum Armoury, Calcutta, India in the 1890's. The problem was that the .303 rifle rounds used by the British Army were not stopping &quot;fanatical&quot; rebels. The first Dum Dum shells were a .303 round with the heavy jacket cut away at the tip to reveal the soft lead core of the bullet. When it hit, the round expanded rapidly, mushrooming and possibly breaking up in the body, creating huge wound channels and exit wounds the size of dinner plates. Any bullet can be &quot;Dum Dummed&quot; by making a series of cuts into the jacket, cutting right through to the lead core of the round. This weakens the round, making it expand faster in the body, but also making it expand on armour, reducing its penetration quite heavily Dum Dum bullets can be made quite easily with a Easy Weaponsmith (10) roll, a file and some time. If this roll is fumbled then the cuts are to numerous or too deep, and when the bullet is fired the core of the bullet will be blown clear of the barrel, leaving the jacket wedged in the chamber. For the eternally hopeful, the lead core is WA -2 and does half damage for the normal round, vs double armour (even if the gun is hopelessly jammed, there is always a chance the core will hit your target). The left over jacket jams in the gun barrel and it difficulty 15 to clear, which could be really bad news in a firefight. SP x 2, Dam x 1.75 after armour. Cost as normal ammo if home made.</p>
<p><a>Gold dot expanders</a> <b>cost x 2</b><br>These are purpose made to expand in a controlled way in the target, mushrooming out till the gold dot of gilding metal at the bottom of the hollow tip is visible. Against armour they act as normal hollow-points SP x2, Damage x1.5 after armour. If they strike an unarmoured target, the controlled expansion comes into effect. Half the dice (round down) of damage are replaced with +4 per dice (example : 2D6 becomes D6+4, 4D6+1 becomes 2D6+9), then damage is x 1.5.</p>
<p><a>Hollow-points</a> <b>cost x 1.5</b><br>These bullets have hollows in the tip that cause the round to expand in the wound channel, making it larger and possibly breaking up the bullet. This expansion makes armour more effective, as the bullet expands as it strikes, spreading across the armours surface. Even light armour can stop a hollow-point due to this effect. Care must also be taken when shooting through furniture or heavy winter clothes, as cloth fibres can clog the hollow, reducing the expansion. SP x 2, Dam x 1.5 after armour.</p>
<p><a>Jacketed hollow-points (JHP)</a> <b>cost x 1.5</b><br>Jacketed hollow-points have metal jackets that reduce there expansion, but hold them together better in penetration. This makes them better against armour than a regular hollow-point round, although it does reduce there expansion in the body. SP x 1.5, Dam x 1.25 after armour</p>
<p><a>Jacketed Soft Point (JSP)</a> <b>cost x 1.5</b><br>The ball is surrounded by a layer of hard metal except for the head that is intended to expand. SP x 2, Dam x 1.5 after armour.</p>
<p><a>Memory expanders</a> <b>cost x 6</b><br>These are &quot;soft kill&quot; weapons, as the bullet is made of a memory metal or ceramic that undergoes a controlled expansion under high impact stresses. Against armour they act like normal bullets, but as they pass through the body they expand, causing an enlarged wound channel. Armour as normal, damage after armour is x 1.5.</p>
<p><a>Mercury cored rounds</a> <b>cost x 2</b><br>These have a well of mercury in the bullets core that is ruptured when the bullet hits, expanding the bullet rapidly. The wounds they cause are also lethal as the mercury has been spread throughout the wound, poisoning the victim (Body roll, target 20. Each point failed by is an hour of poisoning, doing D10 damage). SP x 2, Dam x 1.75 after armour.</p>
<p><a>Plastic expanders</a> <b>cost x 6</b><br>These bullets are made of a high density memory plastic, lighter than normal bullets, and they alter shape in flight deploying into razor edged plastic stars. These tear into flesh, still expanding, and stop quickly. Moving with a fully expanded bullet in a wound is damaging, as the edges cut deeper (D6 damage per round of action). Armour is doubled, damage that penetrates is doubled, long and extreme range are halved (bullet looses its energy quickly).</p>
<p><a>Quick Defence</a> <b>cost x 2</b><br>These are hollow-point rounds with a ball lodged into the mouth of the hollow, giving the round the same domed shape as a normal round, making it less likely to jam in an automatic weapon. When they hit the ball is driven back into the hollow, forcing the expansion of the bullet. This expansion makes armour more effective, as the bullet expands as it strikes. SP x 2, Dam x 1.5 after armour.</p>
<p><a>Semi-jacketed hollow-points</a> <b>cost x 1.5</b><br>These bullets have hollows in the tip that cause the round to expand and a partial jacket to hold the round together enough to let it penetrate a little more than a standard hollow-point. SP x 1.75, Dam x 1.5 after armour.</p>
<p><a>Wadcutter</a> <b>cost x 1.5</b><br>These are designed to expand to give neat holes in paper targets. Against other targets they can be lethal. They are soft lead rounds with a flat top and square &quot;shoulders&quot;. SP x 2, Dam x 1.5 after armour.</p>
<br>
<h3>Exploders</h3>
<p><p>Bullets containing explosives to increase the striking energy on the target. Tip exploders detonate on contact, base exploders on the bullets base impact slightly inside the target.</p><table align="center"><tr><td><b>Weapon calibre</b></td><td><b>Damage bonus</b></td></tr><tr><td>Light</td><td>+2</td></tr><tr><td>Medium</td><td>+D6</td></tr><tr><td>Heavy</td><td>+2D6</td></tr><tr><td>Very heavy</td><td>+2D6</td></tr></table></p>
<p><a>&quot;Rockshot&quot;</a> <b>cost x 6</b><br>Conductive plastic slugs with a piezo-electric tip and explosive granules of C12 or higher high explosive embedded. When the bullet hits the piezo electric tip is crushed, releasing an electric signal that detonates the embedded explosives. As the tip is crushed the soft body of the round expands, flattening across the target, creating a shockwave effect when it detonates.<br>Due to the design these carry much more explosive than simple exploders, and are available for heavy and very heavy calibres only. The Round does damage as an explosive bullet (+2D6) but it also has an effect radius of 1/2 a meter doing blast damage equal to half the bullet damage. Against ANY armour (SP 10 or greater) the bullet hits and explodes, doing 1/3 damage rolled to hit location by trauma, OR normal damage -SP, whichever is higher (normal blunt trauma damage is 1/5 but the HESH effect of rockshot causes a greater impact wound). The larger charge also modifies save by -2 not -1 if it penetrates and explodes. Direct hits on limbs that cause 8+ damage wreck the limb (Mortal 0 wound). Hits of over 16+ damage blow the limb CLEAN OFF.</p>
<p><a>AP-HE (Armour Piercing - High Explosive)</a> <b>cost x 6</b><br>These combine armour piercing and high explosive effects by having the explosive charge fitted into the hollow base of the solid penetrator. This means that the charge is carried deep into the target by the penetrator before it can explode. Against an unarmoured target the bullet does half rolled damage plus the explosive bonus. Against an armoured target the targets SP is halved. Any damage left after armour is halved, then the explosive bonus is added. In either case if the wound is to the head of chest, the target makes there first stun and death saves at -1.</p>
<p><a>Base exploders</a> <b>cost x 3</b><br>These are bullets filled with an explosive compound that is stable to impact, with a detonating charge in the base (usually of a more unstable explosive). When the bullet hits the shockwave travels the length of the bullet to the detonator, allowing the bullet a fraction of a second to penetrate the target. This usually means the bullet either explodes INSIDE the target or lodged into there armour. This does not effect weapons damage or penetration until after armour has been taken into account. If the bullet penetrates, add on the damage bonus to the damage left. Wounds caused are at -1 to stun save on first roll, due to shock. If the wound is to chest or head, them also -1 to first Death Save. If the bullet was stopped by armour, add the damage bonus to the bullets total damage when calculating Blunt Trauma and armour damage.</p>
<p><a>Fragible AP-HE</a> <b>cost x 7</b><br>These are AP penetrators with a HE core and base charge. The round explodes in the body, breaking up the penetrator and scattering its fragments throughout the wound. This makes the round stop in the body, transferring all of its energy rather than shooting through and leaving a narrow wound like most AP rounds. Against unarmoured targets, damage is the HE bonus plus the rolled damage. Against armour, the target's armour is halved, then the HE bonus is subtracted from SP ( as the charge blows it open). If there is any remaining SP, it is subtracted from the rolled damage. If the SP has been defeated, any left over HE bonus is added to the rolled damage. The main advantage over normal AP-HE is that the damage is not halved.</p>
<p><a>HE-AP (High Explosive - Armour Piercing)</a> <b>cost x 6</b><br>These combine high explosive and armour piercing effects by having the armour penetrator surrounded by the explosive material. When the bullet hits the explosive charge detonates, blowing the targets armour open and propelling the penetrator in. Against unarmoured, damage is the HE bonus plus half rolled damage. Against armour, the target's armour is halved, then the HE bonus is subtracted from SP (as the charge blows it open). If their is any remaining SP, it is subtracted from the rolled damage. Any left over damage is halved. If the SP has been defeated, any left over HE bonus is added to the rolled damage, which is then halved.</p>
<p><a>High Explosive hollow-points</a> <b>cost x 4</b><br>Nicknamed &quot;cookie cutters&quot;. These are hollow-point rounds with an explosive core in the base that detonates as the round expands. SP is doubled. If the round penetrates, add on the HE extra damage then multiply by 1.5 due to the rapid expansion. If the round doesn't penetrate, add the explosive damage to the damage to calculate blunt trauma.</p>
<p><a>Shaped charge exploders</a> <b>cost x 5</b><br>These are armour piercing charges made to cut open heavy armour. The explosive charge bonus is added to the damage and half the SP of the armour is subtracted from the damage. Any damage that penetrates is halved. If the target is unarmoured, do not halve the damage, as the blast blows the wound open as a deep wound channel.</p>
<p><a>Tandem charge High Explosive rounds</a> <b>cost x 5</b><br>These are both tip and base exploders, holding two small explosive charges. The first charge blows open the wound and the momentum of the bullet carries the second charge into the wound before it explodes. Each charge does HALF the normal explosion damage (Light +1, Medium +D3, Heavy +D6, Very heavy +D6) this is added to the damage when it hits armour and again after it penetrates : (damage + HE) - SP + HE.</p>
<p><a>Tandem shaped charge</a> <b>cost x 8</b><br>These are armour piercing tandem high explosive rounds. They have the same HE bonus as normal tandem charge rounds, but they halve SP of armour. As the second charge goes off inside the target, the round does damage + HE minus half SP, and any damage that gets through is halved, then the second HE charge is added : ((damage + HE) - (1/2 SP)) / 2 + HE.</p>
<p><a>Tip exploders</a> <b>cost x 3</b><br>Tip exploders have the detonating compound stored right in the bullets tip, so that it's the first part of the bullet to come into contact with the target. This means the bullet explodes straight away. These add the damage bonus from the explosion to the weapons damage as soon as it strikes. This helps in armour penetration, but does not give the shock modifiers to saves that a base exploder uses.</p>
<br>
<h3>Armour Piercing Rounds</h3>
<p><a>Arcane Armour Piercing</a> <b>cost x 4</b><br>The Arcane round is a French made Armour piercing round, using a high power loading with low gas pressure to propel a solid copper cone nosed slug. Designed to be used in modern automatic pistols and revolvers, the round operates within normal safety limits. Damage +1, armours SP is halved. Any damage that penetrates is halved.</p>
<p><a>Armour-Piercing Hard-Core (AP-HC) / Tungsten carbide</a> <b>cost x 15</b><br>Tungsten carbide is a very heavy and very hard metal, used to make the edges of machine tools used to work steel and other metals. Hard core bullets using tungsten carbide as a penetrator wrap a jacket of softer metals around it to stop it stripping the rifling from the gun barrel and leave the sharpened tip exposed where it can punch through armour. Like all hard AP bullets it does not expand, so the wound is only from the bullet passing through. Armour SP is one third. Any damage that penetrates is halved.</p>
<p><a>Depleted Uranium</a> <b>cost x 150</b><br>The uranium is no longer radioactive (allegedly) but is a hard, very heavy metal, making it perfect as a heavy core penetrator for armour piercing bullets. What's more is that Depleted Uranium is dynamically self sharpening, so when it hits its tip breaks off into a new sharp point, a perfect armour penetrator. DU rounds can only be used in very heavy handguns and heavy military calibre rifles (unless custom made for you and your choice of gun). Recent tests seem to show that the dust from combustion of Depleted Uranium may become radioactive again, so wear a dust mask when using these rounds. Radioactive dust may contaminate the firer, the point of impact and along the line of flight, so be careful. The Depleted Uranium is pyrotic and may ignite upon impact / penetration of steel plate at high velocity (fired from an express rifle or cannon only, hitting heavy armour SP 40+, does an extra D3 burn damage a turn for D6+1 turns). Unfortunately, getting DU rounds is very hard, although rumours of Army snipers with DU rounds for &quot;special use&quot; pop up from time to time. Damage +1D6 (pistols), +2D6 (rifles). Armour is at one quarter. Damage after armour is halved.</p>
<p><a>Dominator Overpenetrators</a> <b>cost x 5</b><br>These rounds are designed to penetrate cover with little tumbling, allowing stable &quot;shoot through&quot;. They halve armour like normal armour piercing rounds. Any damage that gets through to the target is halved. Against cover, if they penetrate half its SP they pass straight through and keep on going straight, loosing D6 from there damage. If they hit someone wearing armour and penetrate, they will pass through the victim. Reduce damage by D6 and roll to penetrate half the victims armour on that location, as the bullet passes out the other side of the body and hits the inside of the armour. If it penetrates it passes out, loosing D6 damage and carries on.</p>
<p><a>Full Metal Case (FMC)</a> <b>cost x 1</b><br>Flat head bullet used more for practice than for hunting, quite similar to its big sister the Full Metal Jacket. SP of armour is reduced by 1D6, damage is reduced at 75% from base value.</p>
<p><a>Full Metal Jacket</a> <b>cost x 1.5</b><br>These rounds have a stronger metal jacket all around the bullet, holding it together better in penetration than a normal ball round. While this makes it slightly armour piercing, it will still expand in the wound, causing damage similar to a regular ball round. SP of armour is reduced by 1D6, damage is as normal.</p>
<p><a>Hard core Armour Piercing</a> <b>cost x 3</b><br>These bullets have steel cores under a copper or gilding metal jacket, allowing them to be fired without damaging the guns rifled barrel. Like all hard core bullets they do not expand in the target, so the resulting wound is only caused by the bullet passing straight through the victim rather than expansion. Most military rifle calibre's have steel cored rounds. Armour is halved, damage is halved after armour.</p>
<p><a>High Velocity (HV)</a> <b>cost x 3</b><br>High-Velocity (HV) Ammo is the latest in ultra-hot loaded armor-piercing munitions. Using a secret bullet design and increased powder charge, the HV slugs tear through hard and soft armor, reducing SP to 1/4, but also only doing 1/4 trauma to soft targets. Vehicles, cyberlimbs, etc, hit by HV ammo take full damage at 1/4 SP. Armor penetrated is reduced 3 levels, while unpenetrated armor is still reduced 1 level. Weapons firing HV slugs have their reliability decreased by one level, plus an additional level for every 4 rounds or fraction thereof fired in a burst as the ammo tears the gun apart. Also any weapon firing HV ammo in full-auto has a 25% chance of knocking any precision equipment (laser sights, gas venting, smartlinking, etc) out of whack. Weapons can be modified to fire HV ammo safely, but as a retrofit, this costs 400% of the gun's base price, but automatically includes heat-resistant barrel and receiver for extended autofire. HV ammo cannot be used in combination with electrothermic ammo or hotloads.</p>
<p><a>Raufoss PPi Armour Piercing</a> <b>cost x 4</b><br>These are solid steel rounds with a non discarding sabot of Brass cast around them. They are designed to penetrate armour at high speeds as they are heavy and sharply pointed, and mated to a high power round. The delivered energy is enough to cripple a human target without expansion, unless the target is armoured enough to slow the bullet (SP 20). They can only be used from high velocity weapons (heavy calibre rifles or machine guns) and can never be subsonic. Armour is halved. Damage is halved only if the SP of armour is over 20. Heavy calibre or greater (designed for .50 BMG), cannot be subsonic.</p>
<p><a>Saboted Light Armor Penetrator (SLAP)</a> <b>cost x 20</b><br>The SLAP ammunition incorporates a polymer sabot, which allows the use of a tungsten penetrating projectile with a diameter smaller than the original one. By using the calibre of a heavy cartridge with a light projectile, its speed is greatly increased, and the smaller diameter increases the penetration capacity (the same force applied on a smaller surface gives a higher pressure). Tests were conducted with ammunition smaller than .50 caliber but without success. Armour SP is one third. Any damage that penetrates is halved.</p>
<p><a>Semi Jacketed Exposed Steel Core (SJ ESC)</a> <b>cost x 2</b><br>A bullet developed around a perforating hard core designed to penetrate bullet-proof vests. Armours SP is halved. Any damage that penetrates is halved.</p>
<p><a>Teflon coated rounds / KTW</a> <b>cost x 3</b><br>These rounds are solid metal with a teflon coating that prevents them from stripping the rifling off the inside of your gun barrel. The bullet does not expand in the target, so the wounds are not as large as a normal lead round, but a solid metal spike moving at bullet speeds will cut through body armour like a knife through butter. Once in the body the bullet only flips end over end rather than expanding, so the wounds it causes are deep but not wide, and cause less shock (you'll still bleed to death, you'll just not pass out as fast before hand).<br>With all of these rounds the gun should be cleaned regularly to remove teflon traces from the barrel. A popular misconception is that the teflon coating helps in penetration due to reduced friction, but the smooth teflon layers have been broken up by the barrel rifling, and actually reduce the penetration slightly. The teflon simply serves to protect the barrel from the bullet.<br>KTW rounds use a solid cartridge brass core under their distinctive green teflon coating. Other bullets use steel cores, but all have similar effects. Armours SP is halved. Any damage that penetrates is halved.</p>
<p><a>Titanium rounds</a> <b>cost x 10</b><br>The bullet is solid titanium with a teflon jacket. Titanium is almost half the weight of steel, yet has the same strength, so a bullet made of titanium travels a lot faster than a KTW and slows down quicker in the target. This means that the bullet gathers more energy than a steel one, and gives it up to its target quicker. Unfortunately it means it also slows a lot faster in normal travel, making it armour piercing only at point blank to medium ranges. Armour is at half SP if range is medium or less. Any damage that penetrates is as normal.</p>
<br>
<h3>Flechette Rounds</h3>
<p><a>AP-HE flechettes</a> <b>cost x 7</b><br>These combine a heavy penetrating dart with a explosive thread that ruptures the body of the flechette in the target, breaking it up and stopping it in the targets body. Armour is at one quarter. Damage after armour is as normal +2 from the HE round.</p>
<p><a>Armour Piercing flechettes</a> <b>cost x 5</b><br>These are heavy flechettes of high density alloys that do not bend or deform in the target. They will pass straight through the target without any deviation or fishhooking. Armour is one quarter. Damage after armour is halved.</p>
<p><a>Flechette package</a> <b>cost x 1.5</b><br>This round contains a pack of several flechette darts, which makes the gun into a small shotgun. At point blank range the flechettes hit as a group, all on the same location doing half the normal rounds damage. At longer ranges, treat as an automatic fire burst of rounds. Each hit does 1 point of damage.<br>Light : 3 flechettes, D3.<br>Medium : 5 flechettes, D4.<br>Heavy : 7 flechettes, D6.<br>Very Heavy : 8 flechettes, D6.<br>These are usually used to deliver poisons or burst seals. On automatic fire these rounds can cause mathematical nightmares. Firing 10 rounds from a heavy SMG puts 70 flechettes toward your target. Calculate the normal bonus for autofire using the total flechettes (+1 to hit per 10 rds). For every point over the target number roll the dice noted above to see how many flechettes hit.</p>
<p><a>Fragmentation flechettes</a> <b>cost x 4</b><br>These are pre-stressed to break up as they &quot;fishhook&quot;, breaking into several smaller pieces that slow down faster, transferring more energy to the victim and stopping the flechette in the body (in pieces). Armour is at 1/2 SP. Damage after armour is as normal.</p>
<p><a>High Explosive flechettes</a> <b>cost x 4</b><br>These have a thread of high explosive inside the body of the flechette that detonates when it hits, breaking it up inside the target. This causes similar effects to the fragmentation flechettes, as the remains of the flechette stay in the body. Armour is halved. Damage after armour is +2 (small explosive bullet).</p>
<p><a>Poisoned flechettes</a> <b>cost x 3</b><br>These are light flechettes designed to break up and deliver a toxin into the body of the victim. Dosed with poisoned to make even minor wounds lethal, these are cheap &quot;quick kill&quot; weapons. Toxin types : use any of the toxins from CP2020 rulebook. Armour is at half SP. Damage that penetrates is halved. The cost doesn't include the cost of the toxin.</p>
<p><a>Single flechette rounds / APDS</a> <b>cost x 3</b><br>These contain a single sabotted flechette, which is fired like a normal bullet. When the round leaves the gun the sabot falls away allowing the flechette to fly free at very high speeds. The flechette is Armour Piercing (half SP) and bends when it enters the target, &quot;fishhooking&quot; and twisting. The wounds caused are punctures and tears rather than the &quot;wound channel&quot; of removed flesh that normal bullets leave behind. They usually pass through the victim, exiting at an angle. At point blank range, the sabots have enough energy to cause D6 damage. Armour is halved. Damage after armour is at 2/3 normal.</p>
<br>
<h3>Dual Purpose Rounds</h3>
<p>These are rounds specially designed to have both Armour piercing and enhanced wounding effects.</p>
<p><a>Armour Piercing Incendiary (API)</a> <b>cost x 4</b><br>These have an incendiary filler and a penetrator core, and are designed to be used against armoured vehicles (the AP takes the incendiary inside the armour to ignite fuel or ammunition). Armour is halved, damage after armour is halved. Incendiaries do D3 burn damage for the next D6 turns.</p>
<p><a>Black Talons</a> <b>cost x 5</b><br>These are steel cored rounds with tapered hollow tips. The round is coloured black with a reduced friction coating. Against armour : either counts as armour piercing (SP halved, damage after armour halved). Or as a normal round with some hollow-point character (full SP, damage after armour x 1.25 whichever does the most damage. Without armour : the bullet expands as a hollow-point round (damage x 1.5).</p>
<p><a>Dual purpose</a> <b>cost x 4</b><br>These have a light tungsten carbide rod in a soft lead jacket. When the jacket hits it expands like a hollow-point, but if it hits armour the jacket is stopped and the penetrator rod slides free, acting like an armour piercing round. Against armour : SP is halved, damage is halved after armour. Against an unarmoured target : damage is x 1.5.</p>
<p><a>Glass and steel</a> <b>cost x 3</b><br>The round has a central steel pin with a spun glass coating. If it hits armour the glass is stripped off, leaving a steel penetrator rod. In a soft target the spun glass shreds, starting the round tumbling. Against armour : SP is halved, damage after armour is halved. Against unarmoured : damage is multiplied by D4/2.</p>
<p><a>Hydra-Shok</a> <b>cost x 5</b><br>These have a wad cutter shaped lead jacket around a steel pin. The jacket expands as a wad cutter, and the pin allows some armour piercing ability. Against armour : SP is halved, damage is halved after armour. Against unarmoured target : damage is x 1.75.</p>
<p><a>Multiform SoftKill memory projectiles</a> <b>cost x 10</b><br>Memory expander flechettes. These are state of the art ballistic examples of the wonders of memory metals. When fired they are high density armour piercing flechettes, but fractions of a second after a high power impact they flatten out to heavy discs the size of saucers. Needless to say, this expansion occurs as the bullet is passing through the body, causing massive injury. Armour is one quarter, Damage after armour is x 1.5.</p>
<br>
<h3>Advanced Energy Transfer (AET)</h3>
<p><a>Black top glaser safety slug</a> <b>cost x 30</b><br>This is the almost mythical &quot;Armour Piercing glaser&quot; round that the military are rumoured to have. It can defeat light Kevlar, interior doors, clothes and other light armour. It also acts just like the normal &quot;Blue Top&quot; glasers in all other ways, making it very lethal. Cannot penetrate SP 15 or higher, halves lighter armour, damage x 2, all wounds are -2 to saves. Exact cost is unknown (GM call).</p>
<p><a>Equialloy</a> <b>cost x 2</b><br>These are long aluminium bullets coated in plastic, designed to be used in revolvers. They are very high speed rounds but light so they slow quickly in a target. They cannot pierce SP20 or higher, or thick cover like walls (they were designed to be used inside airplanes in hostage situations). When rolling damage, reroll 1's and 2's. Each dice can only be rerolled once, so the second roll must be taken. If target is wearing armour, only 1's can be rerolled.</p>
<p><a>GECO plastic</a> <b>cost x 2</b><br>The GECO round is hollow through out its length, with a plastic centre pin that falls free after firing. This causes the bullet to tumble in the wound, spinning off at random angles. This causes a lot of tearing and it is possible for the bullet to travel the length of the target before exiting the body. Of course it is possible for the bullet to go into the body and then swerve off to one side and exit leaving only a minor wound as it doesn't expand.<br>Roll D4 divided by 2. If result is 0.5, 1 or 1.5 multiply damage by this number. If a four is rolled, the bullet passed into the next location on the body (equal chance of each), doing normal damage again.</p>
<p><a>Glaser safety slug</a> <b>cost x 20</b><br>These look like blue pencil erasers, big fat plastic coated bullets. The glaser slug is a copper cup filled with liquid teflon and lead shot, sealed with a plastic cap. As the projectile is light it travels very fast, accelerating quickly, and decelerating very quickly when it hits something and when it hits the cup ruptures and the contents spill out and expand in a spherical shape. This allows almost perfect energy transfer and massive shock and wounds. Unfortunately, this also means the bullet is so light it can't penetrate any armour, and even heavy clothes or a wallet can stop it. This also means it can't ricochet or shoot through any target, making it a &quot;safe&quot; round to use in hostage situations or inside buildings. Cannot penetrate any SP greater than 5. Damage x 1 vs targets with SP 4 or less. Damage x 2 against unarmoured targets. Against unarmoured targets all wounds are -2 to saves (stun and death).</p>
<p><a>SPLAT</a> <b>cost x 1</b><br>Synthetic PLastic Ammunition for Training. This was first used as a low lead bullet for target range use, but its lead dust and polymer mix composition makes it break up in targets. this makes it ideal for stopping people. Damage +D6+1 vs soft armour and unarmoured targets. Damage -D6 vs hard armour. Cannot penetrate SP20 or higher, whatever rolled.</p>
<p><a>ThunderZaps</a> <b>cost x 3</b><br>These are plastic composite hollow-point rounds, similar to the SPLAT rounds. Even worse against armour than normal hollow-points, they are lethal against unarmoured targets. Armour SP is doubled. Damage +D6 vs unarmoured targets. Damage after armour is x 1.5.</p>
<p><a>THV</a> <b>cost x 8</b><br>&quot;Très Haute Vitesse&quot;. This bullet uses a revolutionary &quot;reverse ogive&quot; design, as the bullet actually curves inward. It looks like a fat drawing pin that curves out wider down the bullet, but the shape reflects the shock waves of the impact away from the bullet at 90 degrees to the impact. This literally tears the target apart with the shockwave, which is equivalent to a bullet two and a half times the THV's diameter moving at the same speed. The round is Armour Piercing, as the impact pushes the armour apart, and the damage is high. The bullet slows rapidly after impact so it will not shoot through a human target. If used to shoot through cover, it looses all special effects and acts as a normal round. Armour is at half SP, damage is x 2 after armour.</p>
<br>
<h3>Technically Non-Lethal</h3>
<p><a>Ceramic safety rounds</a> <b>cost x 1.5</b><br>These rounds are low powered, brittle and weak, designed to break up on impact with anything hard. They do 1/4 damage to hard targets (SP x 3) and full damage to soft targets (like flesh). They are designed to be used in a situation where collateral damage is more dangerous than the enemy, ie inside orbital habitats, in underwater domes, in industrial plants or oil refineries. SP x3, damage as normal.</p>
<p><a>Electrostun rounds</a> <b>cost x 5</b><br>The tazer darts &quot;Big Brother&quot;, the electrostun round uses a higher power capacitor core and a higher power round, making it as long ranged and deadly as a normal bullet. The bullet itself is lighter than a normal lead round, so it does less tissue damage and is not as useful in penetrating armour. Armour SP x 1.5, damage that penetrates is halved, The shock itself will pass through SP 8 or less, doing a BOD 20 shock (roll Bod + D10 needing a 20+ or pass out for the amount you miss the roll by in minutes).</p>
<p><a>Jelly rounds / gel rounds</a> <b>cost x 1</b><br>These are plastic sacs of inert gel that flatten on impact, delivering a nasty stinging wound but little tissue damage. Intended for crowd control, they hurt but do no lasting damage apart from some nasty bruising. &quot;Accidental&quot; overuse has shown that at close range, on full auto they can injure or even kill a target from trauma alone. Damage is halved, each bullet does only 1 point of real damage, the rest is stun only. Jelly rounds are not much use against armour. Soft armour lets the trauma through (as stun only damage) and hard armour ignores damage totally.</p>
<p><a>Tazer darts</a> <b>cost x 3</b><br>Low velocity capacitor packages, these are fired like normal bullets, but with half normal range, and they are so low power they cannot work the action of a gas-auto weapon (they have to be manually chambered and fired, making any gas auto weapon single shot ROF 1). The bullet itself is a highly charged capacitor, and the leading edge of the bullet is covered in conductive cushioning gel. When it hits, the capacitor is discharged, giving the target an incapacitating high voltage shock (like a normal taser). They can shock through SP 5 or less of armour (ignoring skinweave or subdermal armour) doing a BOD 15 shock (roll Bod + D10 needing a 15+ or pass out for the amount you miss the roll by in minutes). Range is Long maximum. They are too low powered to be fired to extreme range. The bullet itself does half damage, of which 1 point is real and the rest is stun only (soft armour stops as trauma, hard armour ignores damage).</p>
<br>
<h3>Tracers and Incendiaries</h3>
<p><a>Delayed ignition dim tracers</a> <b>cost x 2.5</b><br>All the effects of a delayed ignition tracer but only if used with night vision goggles/sight.</p>
<p><a>Delayed ignition tracers</a> <b>cost x 2</b><br>These have a delay time between firing and the tracer compound igniting, allowing you to remain hidden from attackers. The delay gives you several meters of dead space, so although anyone can tell your general area, your exact position is not immediately obvious. When firing on fully automatic with tracer ammo, roll the skill roll twice and take the best roll. On the second roll, count the burst as HALF the size it is, as some of the bullets have already left the gun. Damage is as normal. At close range or nearer, the tracer has not ignited and so there is no bonus effect.</p>
<p><a>Dim tracers</a> <b>cost x 2</b><br>These have reduced signature tracer elements, leaving only a faint trail in the air to normal sight. On night vision goggles, either IR or low-light, they appear as normal tracers. No bonus on normal sight, as normal tracers for Night vision, IR or low-light.</p>
<p><a>Incendiaries</a> <b>cost x 2</b><br>These contain a core of incendiary material, designed to ignite anything flammable they impact on. Burn damage is an extra D3 damage a round for the next D6 rounds, Anything flammable will ignite if hit.</p>
<p><a>Tracers</a> <b>cost x 1.5</b><br>These have a small incendiary in the base of the bullet that ignites when fired leaving a glowing trail from gun muzzle to point of impact. They allow for accurate auto fire. When firing on fully automatic with tracer ammo, roll the skill roll twice and take the best roll. On the second roll, count the burst as HALF the size it is, as some of the bullets have already left the gun. The drawback with tracers is that they show the enemy where you are. Damage as a normal round.</p>
<br>
<h3>Others</h3>
<p><a>+Power, Plus Power, +P</a> <b>cost x 1.5</b><br>&quot;Plus power&quot; rounds are specially loaded rounds, with more propellant than usual loaded into a normal casing. They are made to deliver as much energy as possible to the bullet, getting the best performance from the calibre. Damage +1.</p>
<p><a>Base expanders</a> <b>cost x 1.5</b><br>These have small hollows in the base of the round that expand as the bullet is in the barrel, pressing into the barrel rifling. This allows the bullet to absorb energy from the propellant more efficiently, but does increase chamber pressures and risk damaging the gun. Can reroll one of the damage dice (this reroll is not compulsory and the user chooses which dice to reroll).</p>
<p><a>Cased telescoped ammo</a> <b>cost x 1.5</b><br>This ammo looks like a short length of plastic tubing. The bullet, propellant and primer are all contained inside the plastic case, which is reinforced to take the pressure and heat of firing. The round can be simply pulled level with the barrel and fired without the need for chambering, loading, pushing or pulling the round into the barrel itself. The heavy case acts as a chamber of its own. The case is then ejected, taking with it a lot of the heat of firing, allowing the gun to use a lightweight ceramic or composite surround.</p>
<p><a>Crawler flechette packages</a> <b>cost x 20</b><br>This round contains a pack of several flechette darts, which makes the gun into a small shotgun. At point blank range the flechettes hit as a group, all on the same location doing half the normal rounds damage. At longer ranges, treat as an automatic fire burst of rounds. Each hit does 1 point of damage (calculate hits as the Flechette package above). These are flechettes with microfine barbs, made of pressure responsive plastic. When it hits it penetrates but stops quickly in the body. Once the flechette is lodged in flesh it &quot;creeps&quot; forward in the wound, as the muscle tenses it is pushed forward, but as the muscle relaxes the barbs dig in, holding the flechette in place. As the barbs are softer on the side of higher pressure, the flechette will turn towards the high pressure areas. This ensures that the flechette will eventually puncture an artery or the heart itself. Death is almost inevitable without skilled medical help, as the flechette is usually constructed of x-ray transparent plastics with the same density as muscle. A Luck roll could help. Make a 30 and it just crawls out of your body. No more damage. Make a 25 and it'll become stuck in the tissue (but will resume crawling if that location is ever injured). If you only make a 20, double all your survival times. If you don't make a 20, you're dead meat. The rupturing and haemorrhaging will kill you. If you don't make the luck rolls, you'll need to know how long you're got to live. If you lie completely still, this'll take time. Haemorrhage occurs within 2D6 minutes on a limb, D6 on the torso. If you're running around active, the muscle flexing speeds the crawlers passage. Time is reduced to D3 minutes, whatever location. Head shots with crawlers are the least fatal of all the wounds, taking D6+1 minutes whatever (the muscles of the head don't flex enough to &quot;crawl&quot; it fast). Treat the puncture and resulting haemorrhage as a failed Death save. If you can lie totally still, hold your breathe and slow your heart, you could live (a death trance chip will stop the progress of the crawler till it wears off, as will cryogenic suspension). A Medtech would have to follow the crawlers passage through your body and pull them out one by one, taking D3 minutes and a Average roll (if they can make a Very Difficult roll, it takes only half the time).</p>
<p><a>Duplex (rifle only)</a> <b>cost x 3</b><br>These pack two projectiles into one round, firing them both at once. This puts twice the bullets towards the target, greatly increasing the chance of a hit. Of course the bullets are smaller and have less propellant behind them, so there is a little loss of power. It is possible to use Duplex with other ammunition types, for example AP-Duplex, or Duplex HE. The smaller bullet size means that any special effects are taken as if the bullet calibre were one class less, so a medium calibre (ie 5.56) HE-Duplex would have two light calibre HE effects.<br>- Single shot : +1 to hit, D6/3 hits.<br>- 3 rounds burst : +2 to hit, 2D3 hits.<br>- Full auto : +1 to hit, counts as twice ROF bullets fired and each point over the target number hits with two rounds.<br>Each bullet does D6 less damage (minimum damage of D6).</p>
<p><a>Electropulse ammunition</a> <b>cost x 50</b><br>EP rounds have a superconductor coil inside the jackets, pumped up to huge voltages. When they impact the coil is discharged into the target, producing a huge voltage pulse and virtually plasmarising it. Damage as a normal round from impact, penetration and other ballistic effects. Added to this is the pulse effect :<br>Light, +D10 damage, Str 20.<br>Medium, +2D10 damage, Str 24.<br>Heavy, +3D10 damage, Str 27.<br>Very Heavy, +4D10 damage, Str 30.<br>Damage is added to the bullets, and the shock effect is calculated once damage is totalled. The target must make a BOD roll, target of the shock value, or pass out for a number of minutes equal to the amount they fail the roll by, and taking the same amount as damage.<br>All Cyberware in the victim will shut down from the shock, taking D6 minutes to reboot (or an Easy cybertech roll). All flammable materials nearby are ignited by the pulse.<br>Electropulse ammo is shipped and sold uncharged, and takes 24 hours plugged into the mains via a special charger (cost 500 eb, holds 6 rounds) to fully charge. A misfire with this ammo causes it to pulse in the barrel, setting off all the other ammo and blowing the gun and the users hand to plasma. Damage to the arm is the same as a normal rounds bonus, plus D10 for extra EP round in the clip.</p>
<p><a>High density ceramic rounds</a> <b>cost x 3</b><br>These are plastic cased rounds with a plastic/ceramic bullet. They have the same ballistic profile as a standard lead round, but will not show up on metal detectors and the casing is invisible to x-rays. To combine with other specialist round types, round cost x 4.</p>
<p><a>Magnum round</a> <b>cost x 2</b><br>This uses a longer round to push the bigger, heavier bullet at high speeds, making a high power round. Damage +D6, the gun must be custom made to take the barrel pressures (examples : .357 magnum .44 magnum .408 TAC and .50 Magnum).</p>
<p><a>Mono-blades a.k.a. Black Razors</a> <b>cost x 4</b><br>These are ceramic bladed tipped rounds, with a supported mono-edge. The mono-edge slices open the target and opens a path for the larger bullet to follow. SP of soft armour is halved, SP of hard armour is as normal, damage is as normal, damage is doubled on a critical (a roll of 10).</p>
<p><a>Monowire trailers</a> <b>cost x 10</b><br>These bullets have a series of short lengths of monowire fixed to the base using diamondoid ceramic beads. The other length of the 12&quot; monoline has a similar bead on it. They unravel in flight, trailing due to the drag of the end beads. They have no effect on the penetration of the round, but the trailing lines have their effect as the bullet is either stopping on the armour or passing through the victim. If it stops on armour, the lines whip round, tangling the victims limbs. Victim rolls Luck, difficulty 15. Pass and the round pulls free. Fail and it catches on another random location (D10). Every action taken while tangled pulls the wire deeper in. Roll D6 each action, and once the total is over the SP it starts cutting up the target for D6 per action.<br>If it passes into the victim, the dragging wires slash out a wider wound channel, adding D10 to the weapons damage. If the round can't pass out of the victim, the wires stay in the wound, waiting to slash the fingers of a waiting medtech.</p>
<p><a>Non aerodynamic</a> <b>cost x 1</b><br>These are flat ended rounds with plastic points fitted onto them. When fired the plastic falls away and the round becomes aerodynamically unstable, having only half the normal range. They are used on rifle ranges where a bullet that misses could shoot off the range and injure someone. Using non aerodynamic rounds and a wall of sandbags, these ranges become safe.</p>
<p><a>Olin Rhino pre-stressed</a> <b>cost x 6</b><br>Pre-stressed spun titanium steel rounds. The bullet has been pre-stressed so it is brittle, splintering into tiny metal fragments the size of hairs. In the body these creep and tear through flesh causing massive tissue damage. The day after a wound in the arm, the whole limb will be a mass of purple, ruptured and livid flesh.<br>Wound advances +1 Level an hour even after stabilisation until flesh amputated / medtech 20 and D6 hours of delicate surgery to remove the fragments (target has to be restabilised every time the wounds advance). Armour is x2, Damage is x 1.5 as the round breaks up and expands in the wound.</p>
<p><a>Phosphiric acid rounds</a> <b>cost x 4</b><br>These have a core of crystalline phosphoric acid, which dissolves in the wound and causes extreme pain and burning sensations to the victim. The bullets are fragile and poor against armour (SP x 1.5). If the bullet wounds the target takes a second stun only wound at save -3 to represent the pain (pain editors will automatically cut this out). Burning sensation drops to -2 and then -1 after time as acid is used up (D6 minutes).</p>
<p><a>Plastic base expanders</a> <b>cost x 2</b><br>This uses a plastic cap on the base of the round to expand in the barrel, absorbing more energy so that the bullet is travelling faster as it leaves the barrel, where the plastic cap falls free. This allows the base expansion system to be used with streamlined and boat tailed slugs. Can reroll one of the damage dice (this reroll is not compulsory and the user chooses which die to reroll).</p>
<p><a>Plastique</a> <b>cost x 2</b><br>Instead of using a fast burning powder or propellant, it is possible to use a weak high explosive as a propellant. The low power plastic explosive used in plastique rounds generates a very high barrel pressure, so the gun has to be purpose made to take the sudden increases in pressure (these rounds are usually of unusual calibre, marked different colours or over long to prevent then being loaded and used in weaker guns, which may explode). Damage +D6.</p>
<p><a>Raufross multi-purpose for .50 HMG</a> <b>cost x 4</b><br>This is a light HE round with an Armour Piercing core. The HE filler is loaded for incendiary effects and a fragmentation sleeve is fitted around the bursting charge. On impact with the target the charge is exploded, the penetrator slides free of the round and punches through the site of the explosion, as the incendiary and fragments effect anyone nearby.<br>Weapon damage is +D6 due to the HE, and SP is halved due to the AP effect. The incendiary ignites the target and anyone in 1 meter of the point of impact for D3 burn damage (for 2 rounds, more if flammable), and anyone nearby is in the fragmentation area (0-1m D3 hits, 2-3m is D3-1, 3-5m is D3-2 hits). Each hit does D4 damage to a random location.</p>
<p><a>Reduced friction coatings</a> <b>cost x 1.5</b><br>These bullet coatings allow the bullet to loose a minimum of energy to friction in the barrel, and so are as energy efficient as possible. The bullet leaves the barrel at high speed. Re-roll one of the damage dice if it comes up a 1.</p>
<p><a>Simunition</a> <b>cost x 1</b><br>Used in live fire wargames exercises, these rounds are composed of soft coloured wax under a plastic coating. When fired they hit with a nasty sting, bursting to reveal the marker colour (red, green, yellow or blue) and raising a nasty welt. Damage is mostly Stun only. One point of real damage is dealt, plus one for every six rolled on the damage dice, the rest is only stun. Stun damage recovers at the rate of one wound level per minute.</p>
<p><a>Survival rounds</a> <b>cost x 1</b><br>These are designed to allow military weapons, especially rifles, to be used for hunting small game. If you were to use a standard ball round the animal would be shredded by the impact. Instead, the survival round uses a standard case loaded with a number of small shot. When fired the shot is propelled down the barrel, spreading out at the muzzle. The barrel rifling causes the shot to spread rapidly and quite unevenly, giving the loading a -1 To Hit modifier. Each round becomes a burst of pellets, each of which does 1 point of damage. Each round holds 2 plus (the weapons minimum damage) in pellets. Treat each shot like an auto-fire burst, so each point over the base difficulty is one extra pellet that hits. A single pellet hit should disable or kill small game like rabbits or birds.</p>
<p><a>Triplex (rifle only)</a> <b>cost x 5</b><br>This packs three bullets into each round of ammunition, taking the duplex idea a step further. Even lighter bullets, these convert a single shot into a three round burst, and make full automatic fire a nightmare of flying lead.<br>- Single shot : +2 to hit, D6/2 hits.<br>- 3 rounds burst : +3 to hit, 3D3 hits.<br>- Full auto : +2 to hit, Counts as three times ROF bullets fired and each point over target number is two bullets hit (yes, two. it's not that accurate).<br>Each bullet does 2D6 less damage (minimum damage of D6).</p>
<p><a>Tumblers</a> <b>cost x 1</b><br>These bullets twist in the target, spinning and tearing. they take on unusual curved paths and exit the body from almost anywhere. Multiply tumbler damage by D4/2, giving a range from x1/2 (minor flesh wound) to x2 (moved into nearest location, equal chance for each possible location).</p>
<br>
<h3>Shotgun Rounds</h3>
<p><a>3Slugs</a> <b>cost x 3</b><br>This unusual ammunition incorporates three large-calibre projectile. The range is limited to 25 meters, but the damage is doubled. Beyond this range, count this ammunition as a slug.</p>
<p><a>APFSDS shell (Armor-Piercing Fin Stabilized Discarding Sabot)</a> <b>cost x 4</b><br>The projectile here is a small (5.5 mm) arrow, with finsto increase accuracy, encased in a plastic &quot;sabot&quot; which separate whenleaving the barrel. The light projectile has a high speed, enhancing it's armor-piercing abilities. Range : 50 m.</p>
<p><a>Ball bearing</a> <b>cost x 1.5</b><br>Instead of a lead slug, ball bearing rounds use a large steel ball-bearing. Damage 5D6, range 30m.</p>
<p><a>Birdshot</a> <b>cost x 0.5</b><br>Birdshot is very effective up to 7 meters, beyond that, do not expect to do any damage. It is often used as a self-defense ammunition.</p>
<p><a>Breaching round</a> <b>cost x 1</b><br>This cartridge contains ceramic projectiles used to tear off the lock or hinges of a door. The splinters on the other side are very limited. This ammunition is highly appreciated by police forces for the rapid penetration of a home.</p>
<p><a>Buckshot</a> <b>cost x 1</b><br>Standard cartridge. It can carry up to 25 meters or even 40. The damage is standard and its availability is very good.</p>
<p><a>CS ferret-chemical penetrators</a> <b>cost x 2</b><br>These are designed to shoot through light cover like interior doors and deliver CS or other gases. Damage target 3D6 + 2m cloud of gas.</p>
<p><a>Flare shell</a> <b>cost x 2</b><br>They allow daylight visibility in a 15 meters radius. If fired directly at a target, they do 2D6+2 damages upon impact, and 1D6/2 each round for 10 rounds or until removed.</p>
<p><a>Flashbang shell</a> <b>cost x 3</b><br>Effect : a stunning blast combined with a dazzling flash. Inflicts 4D10 stun damages, soft armor offers no protection, rigid nesare x1/4. A target failing his Save is stunned for 1D10 minutes. This affects all the targets in a cone 25 m long and 3 m wide, starting at the muzzle of the gun.</p>
<p><a>Gas shell</a> <b>cost x 2</b><br>The area of effect is a 2 meters diameter circle. Effects are the same as gas grenades and varies with the load : tear gas, biotoxin, sleep gas...</p>
<p><a>Hatton round</a> <b>cost x 2</b><br>The Hatton round is a high powered slug used as a door breaker by SWAT and special forces. Damage 6D6, range 10m.</p>
<p><a>HE shell</a> <b>cost x 1.5</b><br>The explosion damages are 4D6 in a half-meter radius. If several bullets hit the same area, the blast radius are added.</p>
<p><a>HEAT shell</a> <b>cost x 2</b><br>This small shaped-charge cartridge deal 4D6 damages to a single target. Armor is x 1/2, but anything that goes throug is at full value.</p>
<p><a>Ninety Cent Special</a> <b>cost x 1</b><br>By loading nine Dimes into a round instead of shot, a crude slug can be made. Accuracy isn't amazing, and range is poor, but when it hits the effects are quite nasty. Against armour its penetration is poor, but the trauma it leaves means the target will know they were hit. Accuracy -2, SP is doubled, Damage 5D6, Damage drops off as the coins start to spread, 4D6 at long, 3D6 at extreme. Cost $0.90 plus weapon smith Easy roll for each slug made.</p>
<p><a>Non-lethal shell</a> <b>cost x 1.5</b><br>This round is made of a compact gel. The damages (4D6) are used fora Stun Save. At least half the damages rolled goes through soft armor. One quarter of the commotion damages are inflicted as real damages, from bruise. Even if nothing goes through armor, the target must succeed a 12 Difficulty REF roll to remain standing.</p>
<p><a>Plastic shot</a> <b>cost x 1</b><br>Used in riot control, and orbital facilities with weak walls. The damages drop off a lot faster over range (normal at point blank and close range but half at others) and are bad against armour (armour SP x 3).</p>
<p><a>R.A.P</a> <b>cost x 5</b><br>The Rocket Assisted Projectile is a slug with a rocket motor, which ignites just after firing. As it accelerates throughout its flight, it has more energy at longer ranges. Range 50m.<br>- Point blanck : 4D6+1, burns for 5 rds.<br>- Close : 5D6, burns for 4 rds.<br>- Medium : 6D6, burns for 3 rds.<br>- Long : 7D6, burns for 2 rds.<br>- Extreme : 7D6+3, burns for 1 round.<br>Also does D6/2 burn damage from remaining fuel, for a number of turns based on fuel remaining.</p>
<p><a>Rubber ball</a> <b>cost x 1.5</b><br>These are &quot;stun&quot; munitions designed for riot control. Below 3m, damage is 1/2 real, 1/2 stun. Over 3m, only 1 point is real, the rest is stun only. Damage 5D6, range 25m.</p>
<p><a>Slasher shell</a> <b>cost x 15</b><br>This antipersonnel shell strings monowire between two specially-weighted slugs. As the slugs travel, they spread appart, pulling the monowire. Damages are 3D6, armor is x1/3. The monowire is 1 meter long and has a 50% chance of wrapping around the target.</p>
<p><a>Slug shell</a> <b>cost x 2</b><br>This round fires a single bullet instead of a swarm of small projectiles. The large projectile is devastating, and has AP effect (armor x 1/2), but damages that goes through is at full value. Damages are 4D6+2 for 12 gauge, 3D6+1 for 20 gauge and 5D6+3 for 10 gauge.</p>
<p><a>Smoke shell</a> <b>cost x 2</b><br>Fill a 3 meters diameter area with a dense, sight-blocking smoke. Different colors available for signaling purpose.</p>
<p><a>Stundart shell</a> <b>cost x 1.5</b><br>This cartridge fires a not-so-small high voltage capacitor. Two metallic protrusions in the front allow the round to discharge its electrical load into the target, giving the round the same effect as a Taser (-2 StunSave).</p>
<p><a>Termite shell</a> <b>cost x 8</b><br>This round fire a narrow (half normal width at range) spray of molten metal at 3000° C, burning through almost anything. Damages are 8D6 AP. Those damages are healed at at third of the normal rate. Each shot has a 10% chance of ruining the barrel.</p>
