<h1>Count Zero</h1>
</center><br>
<div class="c">
<p><i>Count Zero</i> is a sequel to <i>Neuromancer</i>, set in the same dark future universe as its predecessor. <i>Count Zero</i> is very similar to <i>Neuromancer</i>, it's a story of a young cyberspace hacker caught in the net of corporate intrigue.</p>
<br>
<h3>Synopsis</h3>
<p>Turner, corporate mercenary, wakes in a reconstructed body, a beautiful woman by his side. Then Hosaka Corporation reactivates him for a mission more dangerous than the one he's recovering from : Maas-Neotek's chief of R&D is defecting. Turner is the one assigned to get him out intact, along with the biochip he's perfected. But this proves to be of supreme interest to certain other parties -- some of whom aren't remotely human.</p>
<p>Bobby Newmark is entirely human : a rustbelt data-hustler totally unprepared for what comes his way when the defection triggers war in cyberspace. With voodoo on the Net and a price on his head, Newmark thinks he's only trying to get out alive.</p>
