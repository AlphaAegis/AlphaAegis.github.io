<div class="c">
<center><i>A world inside the computer where man has never been. Never before now.</i></center><br>
<p>Tron is a science fiction movie directed by Steven Lisberger. It's a computer classic, one of the first computer generated movies.</p>
<br>
<h3>Synopsis</h3>
<p>Video arcade owner Kevin Flynn is desperate to prove that his video game programs, which have become enormously popular, were stolen from him by his boss at ENCOM, from where he has been terminated. Day after day, he tries to hack into ENCOM's systems, trying to find the information he seeks, only to be thwarted time and again by ENCOM's Master Control Program. The MCP, the &quot;Big Brother&quot; of ENCOM, has been making life difficult for everyone real and virtual, all for the ultimate goal of global domination.</p>
<p>One night, after breaking into ENCOM in yet another attempt to get some answers, Flynn is forcibly split into molecules and pulled into the virtual world by the MCP. In this world, programs (who are the doubles of their users) are being subjugated by the MCP, his right-hand man Sark, and the Warrior Elite of the MCP for their continued faith in their users. Unless the programs pledge allegiance to the MCP and renounce their users, they are subject to constantly being forced into gladiatorial contests on the Game Grid until they de-rezz (die). Flynn must find TRON, the heroic system security program and the only one who can stop the MCP's madness, and help him destroy the MCP to stop the injustices the MCP has been inflicting in both the real and virtual worlds.</p>
