<p><b>Editor's note</b> : <i>kinda lame one, but after <u>little</u> bit of editing it got to some point of sense...</i></p>
<br>
<p>With all this shit in the news and now a book about cyberpunks, we have a bunch of lame assholes who think they are cyberpunks running around blackening the name. In response to this we'd created this g-file so everybody can tell the lamers from the real cyberpunks. Most of these wanna-be cyberpunks will probably be offended by what we're going to say, because the description of what defines a real cyberpunk doesn't apply to them. Remember though, cyberpunk is mostly an attitude (this g-file describes physical manifestations of this attitude), and real cyberpunks don't get upset over something written in a g-file.</p>
