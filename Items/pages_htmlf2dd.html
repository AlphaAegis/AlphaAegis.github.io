<h2>NEW CAREER : PANZER-BOY</h2>
<img src="interface/panzerboy.jpg" class="r"><p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>They say that you were born at the controls of a vehicle; but in reality this is not quite true because it was in the back of a Trauma Team ambulance that your mother gave birth. And this must have been an omen because since you were a kid, you have been attracted to &quot;motor sports&quot;.</p>
<p>At the age of eight or nine, you started to make your first steps in chainsaw-racing (forbidden moped races on urban highways) on bikes stolen in your city. Then it was the passion for stock-car racing; and finally at seventeen, and having cheated on your age, you experienced your first strong emotions in V-Duelling (one-on-one or team races of armored and overarmed vehicles authorized in some states of the USA).</p>
<p>Three years and a rocket later, you stopped V-Duelling for good; you took advantage of having to change an arm and of the money you accumulated during your V-Duelling victories to be wired on a vehicle interface mounted in your last fighting van. Since then, you've gone freelance as a high-risk carrier, made some connections among east coast fixers, northwestern corporatist and central plains nomads. You've even partnered with a former special forces sergeant to protect some of your shipments.</p>
<p>Now you have the wind in your sails : the proof is that you had to rent an office and hire a secretary.</p>
<p><i>- Hello, Klepto, what do you know about these guys : Mark Blackblade, Blinker, Muddleshift and Alix Sanchez ?<br>
... - If they've got this up their asses, they're in deep shit! Thanks, bye.</i></p>
<p>Click.<br>
Then at the truck-bar across the street.</p>
<p><i>- Excuse me, business, you know... Now, if I understand correctly, I have to go to Atlanta to get your two crates without whoever stole them noticing, then bring them back here to Baton Rouge. OK. That'll be $5,000 plus fuel and highway fees.<br>
- Half in advance, as usual ?<br>
- It's a deal.</i></p>
<p>An hour later.</p>
<p><i>- So Muddleshift, you still want to leave the area quietly ?<br>
- Yep.<br>
- Is Atlanta far enough for you ?<br>
- Just about, but how much ?<br>
- I'll be frank, considering the reason you want to leave the area, that'll be $500 per head plus gas and tolls, plus a small job arrived on the spot. The offer is not negotiable, it's take it or leave it.<br>
- Either way, we have no choice...</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The <b>special skill</b> of the panzer-boy is &quot;Daredevil&quot; :</p>
<p>This skill represents the very high qualification of the panzer-boys at the controls of any type of vehicle as well as their technicality as regards piloting in a general way. Because they are really daredevils who dare to make their vehicle do what we ourselves find unimaginable. In terms of play, the value of this skill is added to all its driving and piloting rolls, as well as to all its perception rolls when it is on board a moving vehicle. In fact, trying to beat a panzer-boy on the run is about as difficult as being faster shooter than a solo.</p>
<p>The <b>career skills</b> of a panzer-boy are : Endurance, Awareness/Notice, Heavy Weapons, Weaponsmith, three of the player's choice of all driving skills, and two of Aerotech, AV Tech, Basic Tech et Gyrotech related to his driving skills.</p>
<p>Beginning panzer-boys begin their careers with the following earnings :</p>
<table border=0><tr><td><b>Special skill level</b></td>
<td><b>$/month&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</b></td>
<td><b>Vehicles</b></td>

<tr><td>1-5</td>
