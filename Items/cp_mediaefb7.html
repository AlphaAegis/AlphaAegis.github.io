Any similarities between this and certain movies... was probably intended.</p>
<p><span class="r">Overview:</span> Somewhere is a budding Steven Spielberg, Riddley Scott, Cecil B. DeMille, or Laszlo Kovacs sitting in a classroom, secretly (or not-so-secretly) dreaming up the next <a href="cp_media5200.html?review&amp;id_media=9&amp;lng=us">Blade Runner</a> or <a href="cp_media12e0.html?review&amp;id_media=37&amp;lng=us">Matrix,</a> or some similar mash-up of cyberpunk media. Erden Zikibay and Mohamed Talaat make their case with this cyberpunk short.</p>
<p><span class="r">The Story:</span> It's mid-21st century and Earth government begins an ambitious space exploration endeavor, but getting people to join the effort proves difficult... until they revive an old institution: slavery.<br><br>
I'm going to stop it there since you are already familiar with <i>Blade Runner</i> (and if you're not, WHAT THE FUCK IS WRONG WITH YOU???). <i>Forbidden Dreams</i> draws heavily on <i>Blade Runner,</i> and to a lesser extent, <i>The Matrix</i> (the hunters' outfits and shades). There's no Roy Batty speech at the end, but a quote from Phillip K. Dick that makes the connection obvious.<br><br>
Being a student film, the quality is far from the multi-megadollar Hollywood fare. But for its ten minute run, they use what they had to its best effects.</p>
<p><span class="r">The Bottom Line:</span> You have to give Erden and Mohamed credit: To make a low-budget version of a legendary movie takes some balls. Hopefully they got A's for their effort.<br><br>
For the rest of us, <i>Forbidden Dream</i> would probably be best described as the Cliffs Notes to <i>Blade Runner</i>: it gives you the basic idea behind BR in a ten minute snippet, but you really need to see the full movie, if only for Roy Batty's death speech.</p></div>
