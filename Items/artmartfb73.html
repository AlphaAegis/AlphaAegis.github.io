<a id="ma10"></a><h2>Introduction</h2>
<a id="ma11"></a><h3>Preface</h3>
<div class="b"><p>&quot;From the times of the ancients, the way of martial arts has had five points. Practice, practice, practice, practice and practice. Well, what are you waiting for ? Go ahead !<br>
Me ? It's my siesta time.&quot;</p>
<p>-- Favorite words of the Master</p></div>
<p>The Chinese, Japanese and Korean martial arts are the most well-known in the world, but people forget that these aren't just combat techniques. They are also ways of thinking, true &quot;Arts&quot;, ways of life for the martial artist. Hints for living a better life are the last thing you expect to hear in this decadent age, neh ?</p>

<a id="ma12"></a><h3>Martial Art Spirit</h3>
<p>Battles overflow onto the street. Gangs without codes or morals struggle for the most meager scraps. Nomad packs fight for territory with corps who are at war with each other. Lovers fight with words while drunks swing empty bottles at each other. Not just Friday night, but every night of the week battles occur. Martial arts are simply techniques to defend yourself and/or win a street fight. They inflict much more damage than simple brawling. A master can kill with one strike; it's easier than cooking breakfast. These are the &quot;fine arts&quot; of conflict.</p>
<p>You thinking guns are easier ? Okay. When your gun jams, or breaks, or you drop it because your palms are all sweaty with fear, what are you going to do ? Panic ? Run away ? Can your simple brawling skills defeat that psycho with the BigRipps ? Those are the plans of a soon-to-be dead fool. These are the reasons why the clever solo learns martial arts. And if you join the military, they'll even pay you to learn !</p>
<p>Sure, nowadays anyone can buy martial arts skill chips. Have a nice day ! Even if you're some pasty wirehead, you can still swing nunchakus like the old action movie stars. If not, you can still have a chipped friend do it for you. Well, choomba, I have a message for you, don't underrate the old-style learning. I'm not saying that chips are useless. They were developed to suit a need. But, martial arts are not a trend, or performance. They aren't just &quot;good moves&quot;. They are an Art. The Art of murder; the Art of survival.</p>
<p>For millennia, there was no concept of guns, or cyberware, or all we take for granted now. Martial arts were developed for a time when fighting was up-close and personal. Also, the martial artists were the doctors of the time. When you learn how to cripple someone, you learn anatomy, and how to fix what you break at the same time. Martial arts are also mental schools to learn patience and self-control. If you want to win, you must keep your cool, make good decisions under the worst of conditions. Desires and urges lead to panic and chaos, which are useless in a fight. Through control, you live longer and &quot;healthier,&quot; even when casual. The old-timers call it &quot;winning yourself&quot;.</p>
<p>If you study martial arts the old way, you hear this kind of boring preaching from your sensei. Chips never annoy you with mental effects. Mecha have no minds (eh... unless you include AIs, but an MA chip is a chip. They don't have the MU and CPUs needed for AI thinking). And someone with a mini-sensei plugged in their head is going to get wasted by a human using all of his mind, and maybe his 2 meters of muscle, too ! The reason arts are usable for killing and healing is the spirit of the artist ! You don't need to be tensed up 25 hours a day with control. Sometimes you ought to relax, too. But you must learn <i>when</i> to relax and <i>when</i> to be tense. The higher you get, the easier it is to recognize the <i>when</i>. If your patience gets lost, you'll either be hungry, or dead.</p>
<br>

<a id="ma20"></a><h2>Birth of Martial Arts</h2>
<div class="b"><p>&quot;On street, those like me permitted.<br>
I'm a psycho; won't repress urges.<br>
And you're a fool; love to murder.<br>
We are a wild kind of brother.&quot;</p>
<p>-- Stormy Tyrant singer<br>
Kisaragi Juri (lyrics translated from the Japanese)</p></div>
<p>Martial arts were born to serve a need : the need to fight and defend yourself. Many martial arts were created by those without weapons. In old Japan and China, peasants could be killed for owning swords, so they developed ways to kill without them. Capoeira was developed by Brazilian slaves in manacles. This is one reason why there aren't many martial arts from Europe. There, the peasants were expected to have weapons, and fight for their lords. Granted, they didn't have much armor... Fencing became the martial art of Europe.</p>
<p>They've evolved through trial and error (killing and being killed). But in the 20th century, many arts became sports; the moves were important, but not the thinking. Slowly, the old ways are returning. However, the main emphasis is still on killing techniques. People forget you can heal, too.<br>
New styles are created every day. Some, like the Sovs and the Highriders, have already created new styles. But someday, martial arts created by Cyberpunks, for Cyberpunks, will be born. Will you be the one to do it ?</p>

<a id="ma21"></a><h3>Japan (Nippon)</h3>
<div class="b"><p>&quot;Bodies are scientific; minds are wild.&quot;</p>
<p>-- Huribe Seishi, the creator of Kenkagei-Koppo</p></div>
<p>For such a small country, Japan has a lot of martial arts. It's like a martial arts heaven. Many exotic weapons such as katanas, shuriken, naginatas, kusari-gama, etc, come from Japan, and were developed from agricultural tools because of the strict weapons laws. Most Japanese will say that Sumo (fight for resist) is the oldest of their arts. This is almost true. The oldest is actually called Tegoi (pray with hands; to pray to the 8 million gods and goddesses for power). The arts started with two wrestlers in the old Japan, but the stories also say that the winner kicked the loser to death. Sumo don't kick. Tegoi was an all-purpose style, and allegedly, a master could kill a man in armor with one strike.</p>
<p>Deadly maneuvers (thrust, kick, punch) were forbidden under the laws, and Sumo became the art of grappling, although their ram can be quite deadly. This is the national sport now of Japan. The deadlier arts retreated to the shadows, and were called Koppo (knack of bones). This was used by the secret ninja clans. Recently, it was split into two branches. The ninjas, with their exotic weapons, use Ninjutsu (ninja tech)-Koppo, and Kenkagei (rumble arts)-Koppo, with bare hands. Both were secret until the 20th century.</p>
<p>From the 12th to the 16th century, in the Warring States period, quite a few other styles grew in the political chaos. Aikido (way of coordinating spirit) and Judo (the elastic way) were developed for self-defense. Weapon-oriented styles grew too, but weren't established as formal Budo (martial arts) until the 1600's. These include Kendo (swords), Kyudo (bows), Shuriken-jutsu, So-jutsu (spears), and so on.<br>
Before the 1600's, Okinawa was a different kingdom, with its own language and culture. They had imported martial arts from China, and developed Te (hand) from the Chinese arts. Te was brought to Japan, and the Japanese developed Karate from Te.</p>

<a id="ma22"></a><h3>China (Zhung Guo)</h3>
<div class="b"><p>&quot;The two men stood opposite to one another. Each raised his foot and kicked at the other, when Nomi no Sukune broke with a kick the ribs of Kuyehaya and also kicked and broke his loins and thus killed him. Therefore the land of Taima no Kuyehaya was seized, and was all given to Nomi no Sukune.&quot;</p>
<p>-- Nihongi, Book VI (Suinin Tenno chapter). Suinin Tenno Year 7, Autumn, 7th month, 7th day.</p></div>
<p>The history of the martial arts in China is probably the longest in me world. Certainly its civilization is the oldest. Because of the vast size of China, it may have numerically more styles than Japan. But many arts rise and fall without leaving any physical traces. There is no obvious evidence of when martial arts developed in China. Maybe even from pre-history, hitting styles like Boxing and Karate, or grappling styles like Sumo were being used. This is like Sumo and Koppo, but much earlier.</p>
<p>Evidence points out that most modern arts are connected to the Shaolin temples. Shaolin Kung Fu was developed after exposure of the buddhist priests to the Indian arts, like Kalari. This is the root of the modern Choy Li Fut (named after the founder). Choy Li Fut is found mainly south of the Yangtze river, and so is a &quot;southern style&quot;. Chinese southern styles focus on physical power, quickness and rapid combinations.</p>
<p>Tai Chi Chuan (pole of the whole nature) is also related to Shaolin Kung Fu. Tai Chi belongs to the &quot;northern styles&quot;, and stresses personal power, balance of energy and the smooth flow from stillness to action, and vice versa.</p>
<p>Animal Kung Fu was developed around the 12th or 13th centuries; the origins are not clear. It has many substyles, using the actions of animals as a model. Some substyles are southern, and some are northern. The distinction between southern and northern is for convenience's sake. These are only the beginning point; the styles have been spread and changed throughout the world. The two streams unify at the master level. Beginners tend to focus on the stressed techniques of each style, but Masters use both southern power and northern balance for incredible effects.</p>
<p>There are probably many more styles, but there are just too many, and they aren't always clearly distinct from another.</p>

<a id="ma23"></a><h3>Korea (Hanguk)</h3>
<div class="b"><p>&quot;Like Nature, martial arts must also evolve.&quot;</p>
<p>-- Bruce Lee</p>
<p>&quot;Bruce Lee was a real martial artist !<br>
Sensei created Jeet Kune Do from the other Wushu and taught us the deadliness and virtue of Wushu ! Even though he was killed by Murphy's law at 32, he changed so much, by challenging things with all his power !&quot;</p>
<p>-- Anonymous action cinemaniac</p></div>
<p>The best known Korean art is of course Tae Kwon Do. It was developed, finalized, and spread like wildfire all in the 20th century. The founder of Tae Kwon Do was inspired by Karate, but wanted to make something more practical and powerful than Karate. The true origin comes from Korean history.</p>
<p>In the old times, there were three kingdoms on the Korean peninsula : Koguryo, Silla and Faekche, all competing for dominance. Some texts say an art called Tekkyon was developed in 7th century Silla. Because of this art and the squad of young men called Hwarang-do, Silla, the smallest of the three countries, ruled the peninsula. After a while, Koguryo powered-up, and reconquered the land. Silla fell, but Tekkyon never really died. It was systematized and redeveloped in the 1950s as Tae Kwon Do.</p>

<a id="ma24"></a><h3>Chiropractic</h3>
<p>Martial artists were doctors in the old times, too. Many, if not most, of your Chinese doctors are masters. Shaolin Kung Fu was developed by priests, who are doctors and morticians even now. The master of Kenkagei-Koppo in the 1900's wrote many books about practical techniques, Koppo-Chiropractic and hygiene.</p>
<p>Martial arts are techniques for doing damage to someone and blocking damage from someone effectively. How to hit and break bones, and how to keep yours from being broken. For this, you need (or soon learn the painful way !) a good understanding of anatomy. From this, you can be awakened to Wushu and the Way of the Universe. Understand, kaibi ?</p>
<br>

<a id="ma30"></a><h2>Friday Night Fistfight 2 : the Son of FNFF !</h2>
<div class="b"><p>&quot;Damn cyberware ! Humans can trash mech by hundreds of techniques, using martial arts !&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That's right. And if you martial artists cybered up and chipped in, you'd be that much stronger, theoretically.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Er... eh.. to... that's... but...&quot;</p>
<p>-- Stormy Terror and Shino-Migiude (Death's Right Hand), Osaka, Japan</p></div>
<p>There are two types of hand-to-hand combat in FNFF : Brawling and Martial Arts. Brawling is any type of non-trained streetfighting. You clobber another guy in the bar. Two kids scuffle in the schoolyard. Any time when the participants have had no formal training in a martial art or fighting form, it's Brawling. Experience is gained the hard way, by getting in a lot of fights.</p>
<p>On the other hand, any time the participants have had some kind of training, they are considered to be using Martial Arts. This would include any type of trained fighting : Boxing, Kung Fu, Karate, Savate... anything that requires training and study.</p>
<p>Why the distinction ? Martial artists are trained not only in how to make attacks but also in how to cause the most damage. Rarely, if ever, does a schoolyard bully kill his victim with a punch. But a well-placed chop to the throat, or a boot to the head, can easily kill someone. You just have to know how to do it. As a result Martial Arts attacks are much deadlier than Brawling attacks. In addition, they become deadlier still as a martial artist's level of ability goes up.</p>
<p>Remember, all Hand to Hand combat uses this formula :</p>

<center><p>ATTACKER :<br>
REF + SKILL LEVEL + BONUSES/PENALTIES + 1D10</p>
<p>vs.</p>
<p>DEFENDER :<br>
REF + SKILL LEVEL + BONUSES/PENALTIES + 1D10</p></center>

<p>The side with the greater total wins, and if there's a tie, the defender wins.</p>

<a id="ma31"></a><h3>Damage Bonus</h3>
<p>You learned an martial art style, huh ? Okay, write down your skill level on your hardcopy so you don't forget it. You can add this martial art level to the damage in appropriate key attacks (see below). Also, you add damage depending on your Body strength.</p>
<p>Say you have Martial Arts : Capoeira +10, and you have gone 'borg enough to have a body of 15. If you have Hydraulic Rams in your cyberlegs, your basic kick damage is 6D6 (cyberleg kick of 2D6 x3 for Rams). You have an average damage of 39 points and a max of 54. If you should happen to have a Spike Foot as well, add 2D6 more damage...</p>
<p>Not all martial art attacks have damage bonus. Crush has no bonus; since this comes with cyberhands it's not an martial art attack. Defensive maneuvers like Parry, Dodge or Escape also get no damage bonus, of oourse. If you use your martial art skills to throw an object, your Damage Bonus is halved (see below).</p>

<h4>Damage Modifiers Table</h4>

<table class="r">
<tr><td><b>Body</b></td><td><b>Hand to hand</b></td><td><b>Cast weapon</b></td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>-2</td><td>-1</td></tr>
<tr><td>3-4</td><td>-1</td><td>-1</td></tr>
<tr><td>5-7</td><td>+0</td><td>+0</td></tr>
<tr><td>8-9</td><td>+1</td><td>+1</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>+2</td><td>+1</td></tr>
<tr><td>11-12</td><td>+4</td><td>+2</td></tr>

<tr><td>15+</td><td>+8</td><td>+4</td></tr>
<tr><td>Key attack</td><td>+lvl *</td><td>+lvl *</td></tr>
</table>
<p>* Level of martial art skill.</p>

<a id="ma32"></a><h3>Key Attacks</h3>
<p>See the Martial Arts Form & Specialization table and check out your styles. There are (+) numbers at some maneuvers like Punch or Kick. These are key attacks, the tones of the style. Numbers are To-Hit bonus. For example, Karate has key attacks in Punch, Kick, Disarm and Block. These are the important attacks for Karate users.</p>
<p>There are thirteen maneuver categories in hand to hand combat. Within these thirteen, maneuvers with positive numbers are the key attacks for that style. If the maneuver isn't a key attack in your particular style, you can still try it, but get no bonus in either To-Hit or Damage.</p>
<p><b>Examples :</b> someone with Boxing +5 tries a punch. He adds +3 (key attack bonus) to hit, and +5 and his Body Damage Modifier. If he tries a kick (say, his arms have been shot off...), the only bonus he gets is his Body Damage Modifier. A Tae Kwon Do master gets all of her modifier for both punches and kicks, but not for Rams. A Brawler can try anything, but only gets his Body Damage Modifier.</p>
<p>If you are a martial artist, your key attack also gets some special effects. Read on !</p>

<a id="ma33"></a><h3>Hand to Hand Ranges</h3>
<p>Like missile weapons, there are ranges at Hand to Hand combat. The longest is Casting Range, medium is Hitting Range and the shortest is Grabbing Range.</p>
<p>Hitting Range is the distance in which you can hit someone with a melee weapon. Some weapons such as Naginatas have a longer reach, around two meters.<br>
Casting Range is the distance beyond where you can hit them with a hand-held weapon. You have to Cast (throw) a weapon to nail them.<br>
Grabbing Range is where you can punch or grab them.</p>
<p>Each range has key attacks that fit it (see below). If there is no key attack listed at that range, you can't do it. Some key attacks are split as to what you use, such as Jump Kick (Kick) and Polearm Strike (Strike) that use the bracketed column in the Form & Specialization table.</p>

<h4>Key Attacks Table</h4>
<table class="r">
<tr><td><b>Range</b></td><td><b>Modifier</b></td><td><b>Key attacks possible</b></td></tr>
<tr><td>Casting</td><td>-0</td><td>Block, Dodge, Jump Kick</td></tr>
<tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td>various</td><td>Cast, Ram</td></tr>
<tr><td>Hitting</td><td>+5</td><td>Polearm Strike</td></tr>
<tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td>+3</td><td>Normal weapon Strike</td></tr>
<tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td>-0</td><td>Punch, Kick, Disarm, Sweep, Block, Dodge, Ram</td></tr>
<tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td>-3</td><td>Grapple</td></tr>
<tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td>-5</td><td>Cast</td></tr>
<tr><td>Grabbing</td><td>-0</td><td>Disarm, Grapple, Throw, Hold, Choke, Escape</td></tr>
<tr><td>&nbsp;</td><td>-3</td><td>Punch, Kick, Sweep, Block</td></tr>
<tr><td>Dodge</td><td>-5</td><td>Normal Strike</td></tr>
</table>

<h4>Requierement for Range Change</h4>
<ul>
<li><b>Casting to Hitting :</b> charge ! If you have the greater MA, you may be able to enter Hitting Range (GM's decision).</li>
<li><b>Hitting to Grabbing :</b> make Grapple roll.</li>
<li><b>Grabbing to Hitting :</b> make Parry of Dodge roll.</li>
<li><b>Hitting to Casting :</b> run away ! If you have the greater MA, you may be able to enter Casting Range (GM's decision).</li>
</ul>

<a id="ma34"></a><h3>Wearing Clothers or Not ?</h3>
<p>Some martial arts styles are created for opponents who are wearing clothes or armor on their upper body. Thus, if an opponent is naked from the waist up (a full borg cannot be grabbed like clothes), those kinds of martial arts have no (or less) effect. They are -5 for all attacks except Strike, Punch and Kick against these opponents.<br>
Clothes-based styles : Judo, Sambo.</p>
<p>For example, Japanese Yakuza throw off their shirts/jackets for hand to hand combat for two reasons.<br>
1) It prevents Judo holds and chokes, and<br>
2) The flashing of their tattoos helps frighten opponents. They get +3 to Face-downs.</p>
<p>Also, if you're Yakuza, don't forget to wrap your abdomen in tight bandage wraps. Why ? To prevent your guts from spilling in the street if you get stabbed in the belly by your opponent.</p>
<br>

<img src="interface/martial_arts_02.jpg">

<a id="ma40"></a><h2>Key Attacks</h2>
<a id="ma41"></a><h3>STRIKE/CAST</h3>
<p>This is an attack maneuver using a martial arts weapon. To know which weapons are usable with which style, see the <a href="armblanfb73.html?lng=us" class="r">Melee Weapons</a> page.</p>

<p><b>Skills for Strike attack :</b> Martial Arts, Fencing (blades) or Melee (blunt and impromptu weapons). Impromptu weapons are items that can serve as weapons in times of extremity, like bottles, bats, frying pans, etc. Weapon stats are up to the GM.</p>
<center><p>Bonuses/penalties for Strike :<br>
+ STRIKE KEY ATTACK + WEAPON ACCURACY</p></center>
<p>Strike includes the Cast attack maneuver. Cast is used for Bows & Throwing weapons like shurikens, darts and spears. To use Cast weapons, use the firearms target numbers. But if defenders are martial artists and they make an Awareness roll, they may be able to Dodge or Parry the Cast weapon. If so, the Cast attack becomes an opposed task like melee. Remember to add your range penalties.</p>
<p><b>Skill for Cast attack :</b> Martial Arts, Archery (bows) or Athletics (throwing objects).</p>
<center><p>Bonuses/penalties for Cast :<br>
+ STRIKE KEY ATTACK + WEAPON ACCURACY + RANGE PENALTY</p></center>

<h4>Range Penalty for Casting</h4>
<table class="r">
<tr><td><b>Range</b></td><td><b>Penalty</b></td></tr>
<tr><td>Hitting</td><td>-5</td></tr>
<tr><td>Close</td><td>-0</td></tr>
<tr><td>Medium</td><td>-5</td></tr>
<tr><td>Long</td><td>-10</td></tr>
<tr><td>Extreme</td><td>-15</td></tr>
</table>

<a id="ma42"></a><h3>PUNCH AND KICK</h3>
<p>Normally, humans have four weapons : right & left hands, right & left feet. The basic Punch damage is 1D6/2, and Kick damage is 1D6. Cyberlimbs add to this damage : normal Cyberlimbs are 1D6 Punch / 2D6 Kick, Thickened Myomars are 2D6 / 4D6 and Hydraulic Rams are 3D6 / 6D6. See the Martial Arts Weapons section for more about cyberlimbs and options.</p>
<p>Cyberpunk 2020 said that if you use two weapons together, you must add a -3 penalty for both. Brawling is included in this, but martial arts are excluded. For example, Boxing uses a left feint jab to attack with a right hook. If you learn the martial art of Boxing, with hard practice you neutralize the penalties. Yes, martial arts with Punch key attack can use both hands to punch with no penalty; Punch includes jabs, elbows, knitehand chops, open palm slaps, etc. See the Forms & Specializations table for a listing of the styles.</p>
<p>What about Kicks ? Can martial arts with Kick key attacks use both feet to kick with no penalties ? Usually not. Most of the kicking martial arts execute a three-part combination attack of a feft Punch, right Punch and Kick, in theory. With both feet in the air, you drop to the ground (watch a wrestling drop-kick sometime), but as with all things, there are exceptions. There are four styles that can use both feet at the same time, with no penalties.<br>
Styles using both feet to Kick simultaneously : Savate, Capoeira, Tae Kwon Do, Thai Kick Boxing.</p>
<p>In this rule, both hands or both feet attacks are regarded as one action. But a Punch - Kick combination is not. If you want to use a Punch and a Kick together in the same round, apply the -3 penalty to the second action, as per the multiple action rule. You cannot combine the four attacks with no penalty, even if you are the god of Capoeira.<br>
Also, weapons attached to the fists/feet (Brass Knuckles, Spiked Boots, Cyberhands) can use this key attack with no penalty. If they are held in the hand (Knives, Clubs, etc) and can be dropped, they are used as per Strike.</p>
<p><b>Skills for Punch/Kick attacks :</b> Martial Arts, Brawling.</p>
<center><p>Bonuses/penalties for Punch/Kick :<br>
+ PUNCH/KICK KEY ATTACK + WEAPON ACCURACY (of attached/fitted weapons)</p></center>

<a id="ma43"></a><h3>DISARM</h3>
<p>On a successful roll, you knock or remove a weapon from your opponent's hands. The attacker declares he's attempting a Disarm attack. He adds his Martial Arts/Brawling, etc skill to his REF stat and a D10 roll. The GM could add a size penalty to his roll (small target -4, tiny target -6).</p>
<p>If defender is in All-Out Parry (see below), attacker gets +6 bonus.<br>
If defender is in All-Out Dodge (see below), attacker gets -3 penalty.<br>
If you have no Disarm key attack (Brawling, Sumo, etc), you add the defenders Body Damage Modifier to the To-Hit roll. It's harder to disarm some strong guy with a heavy grip.</p>
<p>The defender adds Dodge & Escape, Athletics or Martial Arts (Dodge) to his REF stat and a D10 roll, but he can't use Fencing or Melee, since he's not trying to parry with his weapon.</p>
<p><b>Skills for Disarm attack :</b> Martial Arts, Fencing, Melee, Brawling.</p>
<center><p>Bonuses/penalties for Disarm :<br>
+ DISARM KEY ATTACK (or -BT Damage Modifier) + Attacker's WEAPON ACCURACY (if a weapon is use for Disarm) + Defender's WEAPON SIZE PENALTY</p></center>
<p>Compare the attacker's and defender's results; if the attacker's is larger, the defender takes no damage, but loses the weapon. Note : attached, fitted, implanted, etc weapons that are not hand-held cannot be the victim of a Disarm attack. Try to take away someone's Wolvers or Spiked Gloves, and you'll see what we mean.</p>

<h4>Defender's Weapon Size Penalty</h4>
<table class="r">
<tr><td><b>Weapon</b></td><td><b>Penalty</b></td></tr>
<tr><td>Normal : rifle, sword</td><td>-0</td></tr>
<tr><td>Small : pistol, SMG, knife</td><td>-4</td></tr>
<tr><td>Tiny : Shuriken, Derringer</td><td>-6</td></tr>

<p>Knock your opponents to the ground by using your feet. He'll suffer -2 to attacks until he stands (taking one action); you'll gain +2 to yours. But once he's down, you must wait for him to stand up, in order to sweep him again. Of course, you can always kick him when he's down...</p>
<p>If you also have a Kick key attack you can make a Sweeping Kick at a -3 penalty. The To-Hit roll is Sweep (not Kick). On a successful Sweep (-3) roll, you do damage of 1D6+3, plus they make a stun roll at -2. If you have cyberlegs, you use the cyberleg kick damage +3 (ex : Hydraulic Rams do 6D6+3 for Sweep Kicks). You get the regular Sweep/Trip bonuses as listed below, too.</p>

<a id="ma45"></a><h3>BLOCK/PARRY</h3>
<p>Block/Parry is a maneuver to intercept your opponent's attack using your weapon, or your hands and feet. This is different from Dodge, because you actually contact their weapon. Dodge is total avoidance of contact. Block is good for those tight spaces where you have no room to dodge. You must declare which weapon you are using to Block/Parry with before you do it : sword, left hand, right foot, jitte, etc.</p>
<p><b>Skills for Block/Parry defense :</b> Martial Arts, Fencing (blades), Melee (blunt and impromptu weapons), Brawling (hands and feet).</p>
<center><p>Bonuses/penalties for Block/Parry :<br>
+ BLOCK KEY DEFENSE + WEAPON ACCURACY (if used)</p></center>
<p>On a successful Parry roll, you can neutralize damage because of weapons and/or armor. But you must check your parrying item to see if it shatters. If it is an edged weapon, roll a D10 and check the table below :</p>
<table class="r">
<tr><td><b>Parrying item</b></td><td><b>Break on a D10</b></td></tr>
<tr><td>Normal edged weapon</td><td>1</td></tr>
<tr><td>Mono-Two *</td><td>1-2</td></tr>
<tr><td>Normal Monoblade</td><td>1-4</td></tr>
<tr><td>Powersword *</td><td>1-5</td></tr>
</table>
<p>* See Chrome 1, page 55.</p>
<p>If it is not an edged weapon, and has an SDP value (and SP like cyberhands and tabletops), the parrying item takes damage first. If it has no SDP, you must calculate the PP (Parrying Points). PP is equal to the maximum damage the weapon would normally cause (Tonfa causes 3D6 damage and has 18 PP). If it is a ranged weapon, use the table below :</p>
<table class="r">
<tr><td><b>Parrying item</b></td><td><b>PP</b></td></tr>
<tr><td>Blowgun</td><td>0</td></tr>
<tr><td>Bow</td><td>5</td></tr>
<tr><td>Pistol</td><td>10</td></tr>
<tr><td>SMG</td><td>15</td></tr>
<tr><td>Rifle or shotgun</td><td>20</td></tr>
</table>
<p>These types of weapons can block the damage equal to the PP. If more damage is inflicted (ex : my kick would cause 20 points against the Tonfa), the extra damage is taken by the weapon, and Parrying weapon's PP is reduced by the number of points of excess damage. The weapon shatters when the PP is reduced to 0. In this case, it is no longer useful, and you or your armor takes the damage.</p>
<p>Even on a failed Parry roll, or when your weapon shatters, you can reduce the damage. Martial arts masters can move that extra bit of a razor-thin margin to save their hides. If your style has a Block key defense, your armor takes damages, and the rest of the damage is reduced by the level of your Martial Arts skill. Then apply the BTM for your final state.</p>
<p><b>Example :</b> Rimbo was attacked in her apartment by a squad of Triad hitters. She wiped out all but one with her handy FN-RAL when she ran out of bullets. Chan Li attacks with his Kendachi Monokatana. Rimbo makes her Block roll with her FN-RAL. The damage was 18, but a FN-RAL has 20 PP so no problem. The next action, Chan rolls a Critical Hit for double damage, and inflicts 35 points ! The FN-RAL is knocked down to (20-15=) 5 PP. Chan's next attack does 15 more points. Rimbo's FN-RAL is cut cleanly in two, and she must endure the rest of the (15-5=) 10 points of damage. As she is has Capoeira +10, and no armor (she was sleeping when they broke in), she can reduce the damage to 0 points. But if she was just a streetpunk she'd take it right to the body.</p>
<p>If you are a martial artist, and see an opponent's casting action (Awareness roll), you may be able to parry the flying weapon. Refer back to Strike/Cast section. On a success, you can Block/Parry the flying object as if you were in melee. Depending on the size of the weapon, you can apply a Parry bonus (longer weapons are easier to parry).</p>
<table class="r">
<tr><td><b>Flying object size</b></td><td><b>Parrying bonus vs Casting</b></td></tr>
<tr><td>Javelin or Thrown Axe</td><td>+6</td></tr>
<tr><td>Arrow or bolt</td><td>+4</td></tr>
<tr><td>Shuriken or dart</td><td>+0</td></tr>
</table>

<a id="ma46"></a><h3>DODGE</h3>
<p>Dodge is another defensive maneuver. On a successful Dodge roll, you take no damage because you weren't hit. Even on a failure, you can reduce the damage like Block. Take damage off of your armor, then subtract your Martial Arts level from the damage, then BTM, if your style has Dodge key defense.</p>
<p><b>Skills for Dodge defense :</b> Martial Arts, Dodge & Escape skill, Athletics (GM's choice).</p>
<center><p>Bonuses/penalties for Dodge :<br>
+ DODGE KEY DEFENSE</p></center>
<p>If you are a martial artist and you see your Opponent's casting (Awareness roll), you may be able to dodge the weapon. Refer back to the Block/Parry section. If you are successful, you can dodge the flying objects as if you were in melee. Depending on the size of the object, you can apply a Dodge bonus (use Block flying object size table).</p>

<a id="ma47"></a><h3>ALL-OUT PARRY AND DODGE</h3>
<p>This is another version of the defensive maneuvers that all punks (including non-martial artists) can do. You can declare just one All-Out Parry or All-Out Dodge in one combat round. You must declare which you select at your first action or your first defense, whichever comes first. If you are in an All-Out defense, you suffer a -3 penalty to all your other actions.</p>
<p><b>All-Out Parry bonuses :</b> you don't need to check your parry. All-attacker's melee weapons (and Cast weapons if you are a martial artist) hit your parrying weapon automatically until it is shattered. Check whether it breaks or not with each hit.<br>
<b>All-Out Dodge bonuses :</b> -2 to all attacker's Strike rolls (and Cast, if you are a martial artist).</p>

<p>If you are a martial artist in an style with key defenses, you can diminish the damage as per the key defense sections above.</p>
<p>In an All-Out defense maneuver, you can roll normal Parry or Dodge when attacked, but there are some limits. If you want to diminish damage using your martial arts twice, the two maneuvers must be different and your martial arts must have both Parry and Dodge key defenses.</p>
<p><b>All-Out Parry + normal Parry :</b> reduce damage through Martial Arts once.<br>
<b>All-Out Parry + normal Dodge :</b> reduce damage through Martial Arts twice.<br>
<b>All-Out Dodge + normal Dodge :</b> reduce damage through Martial Arts once.<br>
<b>All-Out Dodge + normal Parry :</b> reduce damage through Martial Arts twice.<br>
If your skill levels of Parry and Dodge are not the same, reduce the damage separately.</p>

<p><b>Example :</b> Big Bob has Karate +7 and Sumo +4. Karate has Block/Parry key but not Dodge, and Sumo has Dodge key but not Block/Parry. Thus, when he uses his All-Out Parry defense and a normal Dodge (or vice-versa), he reduces the Strike/Cast damage by (7+4=) 11 points.</p>
<p>&quot;Wow, martial artists are invincible !&quot; you may be thinking. Don't worry, martial arts have no effect on guns, lasers, gas, acid...</p>

<a id="ma48"></a><h3>GRAPPLE</h3>
<p>This key action is for entering Grabbing Range from Hitting Range, If successful, you can grab your opponent and can attempt a Throw, Hold/Break and Choke & Crush. Check the next action.<br>
Defender can use Parry, Dodge or Escape to prevent attacker's Grapple. If the attacker's roll is successful, the defender has a -2 penalty to all actions except Escape. But if the defender also attempts a Grapple, both sides enter Grabbing Range and Grapple automatically (no need to roll attack or defense rolls), with no penalty for either side.</p>
<p><b>Skills for Grapple attacks :</b> Martial Arts, Brawling.</p>
<center><p>Bonuses/penalties for Grapple :<br>
+ GRAPPLE KEY ATTACK</p></center>
<p>If you want to enter Hitting Range from Grabbing Range, you must successfully roll a Dodge or Parry roll. But if you are Grappled, you must Escape first. Grapple is a continuous situation. If the defender doesn't Escape successfully, the Grapple continues automatically unless the attacker attempts an attack other than Hold/Break or Choke/Crush.</p>

<a id="ma49"></a><h3>THROW</h3>
<p>Once Grappled or Held, you can try to Throw and knock down your opponent. On a successful Throw, the victim takes 1D6 points of damage, and must make a Stun roll at +2. The victim is at -2 for attacks until he stands (taking one action), and the thrower is at +2 to attack him. Once you have thrown some one, you must re-Grapple to try another Throw. You say &quot;I'm safe at 1D6 because of my armor&quot;. Wrong ! Unless you are in a full borg body, armor does not work against Throw damage. Body Damage Modifiers (and Martial Arts skill level, if a martial artist) are added to inflicted damage, and the victim's BTM is subtracted.</p>
<p>If you fail, there is no effect, and you are still in Grapple. You can always try again with the Multiple-Action Penalty.</p>
<p><b>Skills for Throw attacks :</b> Martial Arts, Athletics.</p>
<center><p>Bonuses/penalties for Throw :<br>
+ THROW KEY ATTACK</p></center>

<a id="ma4A"></a><h3>HOLD/BREAK</h3>
<p>First you must be in Grapple. A Hold is a submission maneuver to lock an opponent's joints and immobilize them (or cause pain). They can be as sophisticated as an Aikido wrist lock, or as basic as a Wrestling pin. A held defender can only attempt to Escape.<br>
On a successful hold, you can Throw or Choke/Crush automatically, because you've immobilized your target (no roll necessary). You can attempt to Break their joints by rolling against the defenders Escape roll on the next action of the Hold, but you cannot Break automatically.</p>
<p><b>Skills for Hold/Break attacks :</b> Martial Arts only.</p>
<center><p>Bonuses/penalties for Hold/Break :<br>
+ HOLD KEY ATTACK</p></center>
<p>To Break you must Hold arms or legs (if you Hold the head or body, you can Throw or Choke/Crush). On a successful Break roll, you do 1D6 damage, plus the victim must make a Stun roll at +2. Most armor and cyberlimbs (including full borgs) do not protect against Breaks, because you are attacking the weakest point, the joints (Double-jointed cyberlimbs are tricky to break because of their added flexibility; -4 to break one of these). It takes 9 points to break a meat limb (in one attack), and cyberlimbs can take their SDP (cumulative) before breaking (a standard cyberlimb becomes useless after 20 points and breaks totally at 30 points, etc). If you trash a limb totally, you must re-Hold another limb before you can try to Break that one, too.</p>
<p>Holds and Breaks are continuous actions, if the defender doesn't Escape successfully, the Hold/Break continues automatically unless the attacker attempts another key attack. If a Break continues over several rounds, damage is inflicted once per round (maximum) automatically.</p>

<a id="ma4B"></a><h3>CHOKE/CRUSH</h3>
<p>If you grapple the body or head, you can attempt to Choke (vs defender's Escape). If you have a cyberhand, you can Crush any parts of the opponent. On a successful Choke/Crush, the defender is at a -2 penalty to all actions except Escape.<br>
If you are holding the defender, you can Choke/Crush automatically, because they are immobilized (you need not roll).</p>
<p>Choke/Crush is a continuous action. If the Defender doesn't successfully Escape, the Choke/Crush goes on automatically unless the attacker attemps a different key action. Choke/Crush damage is automatically taken once per round in an extended Choke/Crush.<br>
Choke damage is 1D6 (+ WA bonus if using martial arts weapon; see descriptions) + Body bonus + Martial Arts skill level (if it has Choke key attack) once per round. Most armors have no effect vs Choke attack unless the armor is specifically designed for protecting the neck against such damage. Of course, full borgs aren't affected by Choke !</p>
<p>Crush damage is 2D6/4D6/6D6 (standard/Thickened Myomar/Hydraulic Rams) + Martial Arts level (if it has Choke key) once per round. Body bonus is not applied to Crush damage.<br>
Maximum crushing damage is the same as a Break. You can attempt a cyber-Crush while Choking with your hands. In such a case, apply the larger damage.</p>
<p><b>Skills for Choke/Crush attacks :</b> Martial Arts, Brawling.</p>
<center><p>Bonuses/penalties for Choke/Crush :<br>
+ CHOKE KEY ATTACK</p></center>

<a id="ma4C"></a><h3>ESCAPE</h3>
<p>This is the defense for Grabbing Range attacks. On a successful roll, you can free yourself from continuous situations. If you are being breaked, you can Escape to a Hold, and from Hold, Choke or Crush, you can Escape to Grapple. Escaping from Grapple gets you to Grabbing Range attacks.</p>
<p>Break --> Hold/Choke/Crush --> Grapple --> Grabbing Range</p>
<p><b>Skills for Escape defense :</b> Martial Arts, Dodge & Escape skill.</p>
<center><p>Bonuses/penalties for Escape :<br>
+ ESCAPE KEY DEFENSE</p></center>
<p>You can also use this key as an active (attack) action. The defender must use the appropriate situation key (Grappe/Hold/Choke) to defend. If the attacker beats the defender's roll, the attacker can flee the situation and move to Hitting or Casting Range (or even farther if he runs fast enough).</p>
<br>

<a id="ma50"></a><h2>Moving Attack Maneuvers</h2>
<p>Normally, attacking while moving takes two actions, one for move and one for attack with a -3 penalty. Moving and attacking are not a good combo. But, Ram and Jump Kick are efficient maneuvers for the martial artist. Both Ram and Jump Kick can be done from rest or running. If you run, you must apply Damage Bonus and To-Hit penalty. You can dash from Hitting Range to half of your MA maximum. The farther you dash, the more damage you do, but the easier it is for them to Dodge.</p>

<h4>Dash Modifier Table</h4>
<table class="r">
<tr><td><b>Dashing distance</b></td><td><b>Damage Bonus</b></td><td><b>Penalty to hit</b></td></tr>
<tr><td>None (in Hitting Range)</td><td>+0</td><td>-0</td></tr>
<tr><td>1/4 of Run</td><td>1/4 of MA</td><td>-2</td></tr>
<tr><td>1/3 of Run</td><td>1/3 of MA</td><td>-4</td></tr>
<tr><td>1/2 of Run</td><td>1/2 of MA</td><td>-6</td></tr>
</table>

<p>To defend against these moving attacks, the defender's defense should be Dodge.<br>
If the defender fails his Dodge, he must do a second check against the attacker's damage based on the formula below. On a failure, the defender falls to the ground and must make a Stun save at -2. He suffers -2 to his next attack and the attacker gains +2 to her next attack.<br>
If the defender uses Block/Parry and wins, he can do damage to the attacker the same as a normal attack, but must make a Falling save. The attacker takes the defender's weapon damage and cannot Dodge or Block to reduce the damage.</p>

<center><p>Knockdown save :<br>

<a id="ma51"></a><h3>Ram</h3>
<p>Ram is a Dash & Tackle maneuver based on one's own weight. Football players may be good at Ramming, but the best is the Sumo wrestler.</p>

<p><b>Skills for Ram attack :</b> Martial Arts, Athletics (Expert : particular sport at GM's discretion).</p>
<center><p>Bonuses/penalties for Ram :<br>
+ RAM KEY ATTACK - DASH PENALTY</p></center>

<p>On a successful roll, you do damage to your opponent according to the following formula :</p>
<center><p>RAM DAMAGE + MARTIAL ART SKILL LEVEL (if it has Ram key attack) + DASH BONUS</p></center>

<h4>Ram Damage Chart</h4>
<table class="r">
<tr><td><b>Body</b></td><td><b>Damage</b></td></tr>
<tr><td>2</td><td>1D6-2</td></tr>
<tr><td>3-4</td><td>1D6-1</td></tr>
<tr><td>5</td><td>1D6</td></tr>
<tr><td>6-7</td><td>2D6</td></tr>
<tr><td>8-9</td><td>2D6+1</td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>2D6+2</td></tr>
<tr><td>11-12</td><td>3D6+4</td></tr>
<tr><td>13-14</td><td>3D6+6</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>3D6+8</td></tr>
<tr><td>16-20</td><td>4D6+8</td></tr>
<tr><td>each +</td><td>each + 1D6</td></tr>
</table>

<p>So, if your Body is 12, you do damage of 3D6+4 + Martial Arts level from Hitting range. If you run, you add damage. Thus, the greater your weight, the greater damage you can inflict (all fractions rounded up). This is why Sumo wrestlers and defensive linebackers are so huge.</p>

<a id="ma52"></a><h3>Jump Kick</h3>
<p>Only if you have martial arts with a Kick key attack can you Jump Kick with any effectiveness. You get a -5 penalty to Hit automatically.</p>
<p>You do an Awhooo!-ing Jump (you don't need to yell, but...) and Kick simultaneously at the target, from 1/2 Leap to 1/2 of Run. You can jump over small obstacles like mines, ditches, dead bodies, etc. On a successful Jump Kick roll, you inflict 1D6+5 damage. If you have standard cyberlegs, its 2D6+5, Thickened Myomar is 4D6+5, Hydraulic Rams are 6D6+5, etc.</p>

+ KICK KEY ATTACK - 5 + WEAPON ACCURACY of implanted/fitted weaponry (spike heels, talon feet, Spiked Boots, etc)</p></center>

<a id="ma53"></a><h3>Stun Attack</h3>
<p>Sometimes you must stop your opponent without harming him. This is a non-lethal maneuver to stun. Do you think it's easier than killing ? Not ! You must hit a vital point while &quot;pulling&quot; your power. You suffer a -6 penalty to hit since this attack is aimed at a tiny point while controlling your strength. If your attack succeeds, your opponent must make a Stun save with a penalty of half your Martial Arts skill level (- victim's Martial Arts skill level, if any). If the victim fails his save, he falls unconscious. Whether he succeeds or not, he takes only 1 point of damage from the attack.</p>

<a id="ma54"></a><h3>Chiropratics</h3>
<p>Martial arts masters can use their skill in taking people apart to also put them back together (in the Middle Ages, beheaders often became ear, nose and throat doctors upon retirement too). You can add 1/3 of your Martial Art level to Diagnose Illness, First Aid and Medical Tech, only. This only applies to people who've learned martial arts the hard way. Martial arts skill chips only give you combat bonuses.</p>

<a id="ma55"></a><h3>Additional Rules</h3>
<p><b>Weapons :</b> depending on the martial art learned, it also might teach the use of a variety of weapons. Anything with a Strike bonus offers weapons training. There are also some, like Thamoc that have no bonus, but train in specific weapons anyway (in this case the tonfa / nightstick). For every point of Martial Art skill you have (providing it has a strike bonus, or is somehow otherwise tied to a weapon) you may choose 2 melee weapons to master. At a Skill of 10 you are assumed to have mastered all weapons tied to that martial art.</p>
<p><b>Formless martial arts :</b> some martial arts, like Jeet Kune Do, Krav Maga, Streetfighting and U-Ra-Do, don't teach specific techniques and forms, instead they teach moves tailored to the individuals strengths and weaknesses. In situations like this, it is best to add up the bonus points of the art, and re-apply them to suit the practitioners needs.</p>
<p><b>Falling :</b> this is an ability common to every martial art available, basically it is just knowing the proper way to fall and take the least amount of damage, a martial artist can divide the dice value of damage taken from falling by half.</p>
<p><b>Katas :</b> katas serve dual purposes, in one sense they are away to work out, stretch and meditate simultaneously, in another sense they accustom the artist to his art, till it becomes a second nature.</p>
<p><b>Meditation :</b> while meditation is not singular to the martial arts, it is a very important part of it to many of them, although most of the western arts do not place much importance on the benefits of meditation.</p>
<p><b>One-inch punch :</b> this is an ability made famous by the legendary Bruce Lee, and involves focusing all the energy and momentum of your body into one place, then starting with the fingers extended and touching the target, you quickly close your fist and punch the distance of your closed fingers. While in combat it doesn't offer many benefits, it does act as a full fledged punch, doing the same amount of damage.</p>
<p><b>Iron Fist :</b> this takes years of conditioning the hands. It starts with the artist pounding his fists and feet into the sand, then graduating to trees, to rock, in some cases going as far as glass and burning coals. The purpose of this is to build up hard callouses on the hands and feet, which will allow the artist to drive his hand through wood, blocks of ice, etc. While it really provides no combat benefits, it can be used to shatter barriers and to show off skills.</p>
<p><b>Dim Mak :</b> this is the deadly touch of death, available only to disciples of the Tien Hsueh. To use the touch of death you must first concentrate for 3 rounds. During these three rounds you may not make any other actions, and if you do, or are interrupted, you must start all over again. Next roll a succesfull punch, and this roll must succeed by at least 5 points over your opponents block/parry or dodge roll. A succesful roll indicates that the strike was performed correctly. To determine how long it will take for the effect of the strike to take place roll 2D6 with an additional day for every level of the artists skill (at a 10 skill level the artist can choose how long it takes up to 25 days). The victim can roll a save (Body + Luck + Resist Torture/Drugs *or endurance, whichever you feel is more applicable* + roll), but it must be higher than the attackers total strike roll +1 point per day that goes by. The victim can only roll once per day, and unless the victim recognized the technique he or she will be unaware anything is wrong (so the GM should probably make their save rolls without telling the character what is happening). The victim will feel perfectly normal until the fated day arrives, then suddenly and without warning he will he will suffer an aneurysm and die.<br>
While Tien Hsueh is the only art in the world that actively teaches this technique, it has spread very rarely to other forms, and is usually kept as a closely guarded written secret, kept only in the most remote of temples and dojo's, and known only to the eldest, most revered masters. In these situations the technique was usually stolen as a means to defend against the masters of the death touch, and it is under no circumstances actually taught unless the master feels a very real threat from the Tien Hsueh.</p>

<a id="ma60"></a><h2>Martial Arts Form & Specialization</h2>
<a id="ma61"></a><h3>Martial Arts Families</h3>
<p>Languages have linguistic families, and it is easier to learn a language similar to the one you already knew (reduce IP multiplier by -1). This rule can be used in martial arts as well. There are many martial arts in the world, but many can be categorized by origin and techniques into a martial arts family. Once you've learned one martial art, you may learn any other art in the same family with a reduced (by one) IP multiplier (minimum IP multiplier is 1).</p>
<p>For example, you've learned Tae Kwon Do already. If you want to learn Karate next, you can reduce the Karate IP multiplier from (2) to (1).</p>

<a id="ma63"></a><h3>Martial Arts Descriptions</h3>
<p><a id="mafs1"><b>African Kickfighting :</b></a> a popular form of sparring on the subcontinent, basically involving two tribesmen to kick each other senseless. Not a formal style and almost unheard of outside of africa.</p>
<p><a id="mafs2"><b>African Monkey Style :</b></a> similiar to the Chinese monkey boxing only in that it tries to emulate the behavior of the primate, African monkey style is far more bestial and savage, and not as refined or polished. No forms, really just a very primal outburst, complete with scratching and biting, and lots of noise. Unheard of outside of Africa.</p>
<p><a id="mafs78"><b>African Stick Fighting :</b></a> it is, like wrestling, popular and traditional in almost every part of Africa. Nowadays however stick fighting is used almost entirely for ceremony, as the horrors of constant civil war in most of Africa make it all but useless.</p>
<p><a id="mafs3"><b>Agrippa :</b></a> Italian fencing art, characterized by its highly defensive maneuvers.</p>
<p><a id="mafs4"><b>Aikido :</b></a> defensive martial art. Fairly common anywhere in the world it teaches its users to wait until attacked and then proceed to break the offending arm, leg or whatever. Taught everywhere, though the techniques are very difficult to master. Lesser forms, which aren't as extensive, are often passed off as aikido.</p>
<p><a id="mafs5"><b>Aikijitsu :</b></a> an ancient Japanese art, taught to samurai so they would not be defenseless when unarmed. It focuses on strikes, pressure points, disarms and throws, and is meant to be used until a samurai can procure himself a weapon. Very rarely taught outside of Japan, and even in Japan it is fairly rare, the few practitioners who do teach it are generally feudal enthusiasts.</p>
<p><a id="mafs6"><b>American Kickboxing :</b></a> a very watered down form of Muay Thai. When someone tells you they are an expert kickboxer this is usually what they are talking about. It doesn't have the conditioning exercises or rigourous, almost torturous, training of the Thai martial art, and is instead more for tournament fighting along the tamer american and european rules. Taught everywhere.</p>
<p><a id="mafs65"><b>American Kung Fu :</b></a> this is your basic Kung Fu taught all over the United States and Europe. It is a bastardized mutt of many different forms with each school seeming to specialize in its own style. While not as advantageous as other forms of Kung Fu it is a good martial art in its own right, it is very indistinct and easier to learn. Taught everywhere.</p>

<p><a id="mafs17"><b>Capoeira :</b></a> developed by Brazilian slaves this style resembles a tribal dance.</p>
<p><a id="mafs18"><b>Catch-as-catch-can Wrestling :</b></a> a hybrid competition martial art that tried to encompass everything, though not very well.

Students are only taught the basics of surviving a gunfight : stay constantly moving, fire till your opponent is dead (preferably from as close a distance as possible), count your shots, when you are out don't hesitate to find another weapon instead of taking the time to reload yours (the dead guy on the floor won't be needing his anymore right). If you are hit don't think about it till your dead or your enemies are, never panic and above all keep your opponent on the defensive. Once a student has learned the basics the only way for him to advance in his art is through combat, so beginners don't stay beginners long, they are either killed or they become better. A master is a truly magnificent sight in a gun battle.</p>

Traceurs, as practitioners of Jattenhand are known, can often be recognized illuminated bands of color worn somewhere on the traceurs body. Most commonly these illuminated bands are displayed on wrists and ankles, so that when in motion a traceur literally leaves behind a light trail. Basic training generally involves a series of &quot;follow the leader&quot; type sessions, where the mäster starts out in charge, running an ever different and varying obstacle course through the city. As the students learn to keep up they eventually progress to a level where they take the leader position for other students, with the mäster watching from the sidelines, for technique and inventiveness. Graduation to mastery come when the student can challenge the mäster, and succesfully lose him in a chase, whether by making him fall or by simply losing him. The rules of the chases are simple, no &quot;civilian&quot; interference, no property damage. Among the student led chases, the &quot;leader&quot; position can be challenged to unarmed combat at any time, but the chase has to keep moving, even during the fight. If a combatant falls, is seperated from the chase and loses all rights of challenge that day. A fall is defined as cessation of controlled motion for longer than one round. If the leader of the chase hits a dead end or can't continue the chase he loses leadership rights to any chases for a week (or more at the mäster's discretion). The philosophy Jattenhand is simple, &quot;always keep movig, no matter what, to rest is to die !&quot;.</p>
<p><a id="mafs47"><b>Jeet Kune Do :</b></a> the style of Kung Fu developed and made famous by the legendary Bruce Lee. The reason he developed it was because he was sick of the forms recognized in most other styles of Kung Fu, his thoughts being that the forms let your opponent know your moves in advance and that gave away too much of an advantage so he developed his own style.

Its primary philosphy is to defend against larger, heavier, usually armed, and usually male, opponents. This kata for this skill is a very graceful, dance, that resembles a cross between ballet and tribal dances.

The art is equally effective against group as it is single opponents. In more desperate times the art also teaches dirty tricks and escape tactics. Very rare, but taught worldwide, new students are generally chosen after a careful screening process.</p>

<p><a id="mafs61"><b>Krabi Krabong :</b></a> quite possibly the fastest and most dangerous weapons art in the world. Originate from Burma and Thailand, Krabie Krabong is the armed version of Muay Thai. While spears, staves and other weapons are among its arsenal, the main weapon of Krabi Krabong is the Daab (or Dha), a short, light curved blade with long handle (usually over half the length of the blade). The Daab's are wielded in pairs and are used much like (and with the same amazing speed) Eskrima sticks. Traditional forms have included some rather odd looking leaping attacks that look like hops, but in combat these are discarded in favor of more effective movement. Where Kenjutsu is gracefull and fluid, Krabi Krabong is furious and frenzied. Very rarely found outside of Thailand.</p>
<p><a id="mafs62"><b>Krav-Maga :</b></a> this Isreali martial art was founded after WWII by a holocaust survivor. It incorporates the most deadly and effective moves from the various martial arts and street fighting techniques around the world.

<p><a id="mafs66"><b>Kuo-Chu'an :</b></a> (Dog Style Kung Fu) perhaps the most comedic of all martial arts but don't be fooled, for it is also one of the most effective. Practitioners, upon being attacked, will feign injury to the point of obvious melodrama : falling to the ground, rolling around, wailing like a child, and generally giving the appearance of a fool who is overly sensitive and has no business fighting. But it's all an elaborate ruse to get the opponent to underestimate them, thus causing the opponent to be off guard, and when their opponent is sufficiently lulled into sense of superiority the silliness ceases and the attacks become very fierce often destroying the attacker before he knew what happened. To further this deception, in any fight that is not a serious student of dog boxing will always purposely lose. Almost unheard of outside of China, and even in the country it is very rare.</p>
<p><a id="mafs67"><b>Kupigana Ngumi :</b></a> known as the &quot;Essence of African Martial Arts&quot;, Kupigana Ngumi is representative of many African martial arts. It is a very dancelike system and focuses on style over substance.</p>

Body hardening also plays an important part and students subject themselves to having things broken over them or hurled at them or whatever else their masters can think of. Common all over the world.</p>
<p><a id="mafs69"><b>Lee Kwan Choo :</b></a> this is perhaps the greatest martial art of all, because it truly is only for defense. It is impossible to damage an opponent using this form. Meditation and spiritual enlightenment are a big part of this completely non-violent martial art. Geared completely towards avoidance attacks are made but cause no damage whatsoever, stopping just before contact and effectively stunning an opponent without actually striking him.

This form is only taught in remote Chinese monasteries.</p>
<p><a id="mafs70"><b>Li-Chia :</b></a> (Short Hand Kung Fu) always remaining within arms reach of his opponent, the practitioner of this martial art attacks straight on with as many punches and snap kicks as possible until his opponent has been beaten into submission.

<p><a id="mafs76"><b>Muay Thai :</b></a> (Thai Kickboxing) one of the deadliest martial arts in the world. While it involves many spirtual aspects and ceremonies, the art itself is simply brutal. From the age where they can walk young children in Thailand are taught this ultraviolent form of kick boxing. The death toll from this sport in Thailand is staggering, especially today where bloodports are the most sought after forms of entertainment. As if that wasn't enough, organized crime controls the sport completely and lives are traded daily for the entertainment of the crowds and the money they lose gambling. Fixing a fight is common and if the fighter refuses to throw it they are killed along with their families and friends. True Muay Thai is rare outside of Thailand, though not unheard of.</p>
<p><a id="mafs77"><b>Ninjutsu :</b></a> this is not the fake Ninjutsu you find in survivalist camps that cater to the paranoid. This is the real thing, the ancient art of assassination, one of the oldest styles in Japan. It's a all-purpose style, with many key actions, so it is very hard to learn.

<p><a id="mafs88"><b>Savate :</b></a> the French art of kickboxing, this is another martial art that has enjoyed success throughout Europe but has never hit big anywhere else.

Not all practitioners however, are malevolent, in fact some practitioners are well respected healers, due to their innate knowledge of human anatomy and the flow of chi.</p>
<p><a id="mafs102"><b>Trash Boxing :</b></a> like Capoeira, this form integrates dance movements into a powerful fighting style.

<a id="ma70"></a><h2>Martial Arts Weapons</h2>
<p>Literally, these are weapons for those who have mastered the martial arts. However, you don't need to have martial arts skills to use them. Even if you don't know Kendo (Japanese fencing), you can slash with a Katana. If you punch with Brass Knuckles with all your might someone's going to be in pain. Anyone can handle a martial art weapon, if they really want to. Of course, their enemies won't be blown away with one strike like a martial artist can do.</p>
<p>Martial artists know how to draw out the maximum ability of their weapons (although the vids do tend to exaggerate). If you have not learned martial arts, it means you just rely on the inherent destructive power of the weapon. This is perfectly normal. Martial arts weapons can have the power to slaughter cyberpsychos (there aren't many bears and tigers anymore, cyberpsychos will just have to substitute !) only when the technique of those who use it - and the destructiveness of the weapon - unite.</p>

<a id="ma71"></a><h3>Styles of Martial Arts Weapons</h3>
<p>Of course, martial arts have styles, such as Judo, Thai Kick Boxing and others. Everyone knows this. According to the style, different weapons are used. If you could use them easily, everyone would be martial artists, neh ?</p>
<p>Unless the style of the martial art and the weapon are the same, you can't use your martial art skill, and you don't add your martial art bonuses to damage. In that case, you'd usually use Melee for the To-Hit roll. This will add IP to your Melee, but not your martial art.</p>
<p><b>Example :</b> Maria &quot;Stormy Terror&quot; Chung took a Kusari-gama from her late friend's body as a keepsake. The Kusari-gama's style is Ninjutsu. She only has Choy Li Fut, Tae Kwon Do and Aikido (what ?! You say that's enough ?). Therefore, she cannot use the Kusuni-gama with any bonus. She might as well give it to a punk.<br>
She finally put the Kusari-gama on her wall, to remember her friend, thinking that one day she will master Ninjutsu.</p>

<a id="ma72"></a><h3>Types of Martial Arts Weapons</h3>
<p>Every martial art has key actions. Some of the attacks, such as Punches, Kicle and Holds, will get a To-Hit bonus. This makes it different from an ordinary scuffle.</p>
<p>Ordinary martial arts weapons are used by Strike, not Punches and Kicks. In other words, the weapon's techniques have been polished up by the masters along with Punches and Kicks. It's like the difference between Brawling and Melee. If the key attacks for your style do not include Strike/Cast, it's a martial art which doesn't use weapons (the art is so strong that you don't need to use them). Example : Karate and Sumo don't use weapons, although things like some cyberweapons or fitted weapons (spiked boots or gloves) may be added for extra damage.</p>
<p>All the martial art weapons have types. It decides how the weapon is used : Strikes, Punches or Kicks. After all, a martial arts weapon becomes really deadly only when combined with the same style martial art, and using the key attack of the weapon.</p>
<p><b>Example :</b> &quot;Stormy Terror&quot; usually comes her Bo. Its style is Choy Li Fut and is type is Strike. One day she was careless and left home without it. As is often the case, she got in trouble, and was surrounded by a hungry gang in the street. Fortunately, she had not forgotten to put on her SMP-2 Battleglove Plus and Knee Spikes. All styles can use these, and are perfect for her Tae Kwon Do. Therefore, the poor gang members were sent to the hospital. The storm having passed, Maria could get to the sushi-bar she likes so much.</p>

<a id="ma73"></a><h3>Weapon Descriptions</h3>
<p>Martial arts weapons are divided into two groups : whether the type is Strike/Cast, or something else. Weapons that are in the Strike/Cast category always have styles, the other weapons basically have no restrictions.</p>

<h4>Strike Type Weapons</h4>
<p>Some weapons can be used to Grapple, Hold or Choke, but to roll damage, you must use Strike. Even if the key attacks have Choke or Hold, you cannot add To-Hit bonus. Holding with a weapon, and Holding with your hands are two totally different things. For Grapple, as long as it is not a special weapon, you do it by using your hands (To-Hit bonus of the key attack can be added).</p>

<h4>Cast Type Weapons</h4>
<p>This covers bows and all thrown objects. For throwing weapons, damage bonus by Body is one-half that of Strike (round-up fractions). If you Cast weapons that would normally be used for Strike, the basic damage does not change : no strength bonus.</p>
<p>Bows do not have a strength bonus, but you can order one that is suited for your Body Type, and then you get a bonus (these bows also cost a lot more).<br>
Cast type weapons get the martial art bonuses if they are used in the correct martial art with Strike/Cast key attack.<br>
Martial arts without Strike/Cast key attacks, Archery (bows), or Athletics (throwing weapons) can use casting weapons, but get no bonuses.</p>
