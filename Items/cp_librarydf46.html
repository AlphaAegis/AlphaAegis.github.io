<h1>Schismatrix</h1>
</center><br>
<div class="c">
<p>Bruce Sterling himself has called his Shaper/Mechanist novel <i>Schismatrix</i> &quot;my favorite among my books&quot;. It is a detailed history of a spacefaring humanity divided into two camps : the Shapers, who prefer genetic enhancements, and the Mechanists, who rely on prosthetics. Sterling also published five Shaper/Mechanist stories between 1982-84, which have been collected with the novel in this compendium volume. This book represents the definitive collection of what is arguably Sterling's most intense work, offering a hard, gritty look at humanity as it pushes and claws its way to the stars.</p>
<br>
<h3>Synopsis</h3>
<p>From the pioneer of crucial, cutting-edge science fiction comes the stunning world of the Schismatrix, where Shaper revolutionaries struggle against aristocratic Mechanists for ultimate control of human destiny.</p>
