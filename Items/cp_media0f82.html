<div class="c">
<p><i>Brazil</i> is a science fiction and fantasy movie directed by Terry Gilliam and written by Terry Gilliam and Charles McKeown.</p>
<br>
<h3>Synopsis</h3>
<p>Sam Lowry is a harried technocrat in a futuristic Orwellian society that is needlessly convoluted and inefficient and where the populace are completely controlled by the state, but technology remains almost as it was in the 1970's. He dreams of a life where he can fly away from technology and overpowering bureaucracy, and spend eternity with the woman of his dreams. One day he spots a mistake in one of the pieces of paperwork passing through his office. The mistake leads to the arrest of an entirely innocent man, one Harry Buttle. While trying to rectify the wrongful arrest, Lowry meets the woman he is always chasing in his dreams, Jill Layton. Meanwhile, the bureaucracy has fingered him responsible for a rash of terrorist bombings, and both Sam and Jill's lives are put in danger as they are hunted by the state himself.</p>
