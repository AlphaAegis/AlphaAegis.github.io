		<h4>Review</h4>
		<p>Big brother of Solo of Fortune, this new version was going to be better than the old one : a more pleasant model, a more copious supplement. Unfortunately it's nothing like that and Solo of Fortune 2 doesn't bring anything new : how to customize your gun, how to find MORE powerful weapons, MORE armored vehicles, MORE stronger NPCs... The plan is the same as in the previous one : we'll find a few theaters of operations in Eastern Europe, badly written stories, job offers, cheap inspirations, and even more material to blow other guys' faces off. As in SoF 1, some ideas are good, but there's a lot of selecting to be done.</p>
