		<h4>Review</h4>
		<p>For this scenario, I won't talk about the maquette or the illustrations : Atlas Games has already amply proven its ability to spoil our appetite by visual means. The story is very classic : a kid has been kidnapped and the PCs have to investigate to find him. The fall is potentially interesting, but the scenario will require a lot of work to get out of the basic investigation. In short, this scenario doesn't even deserve the $9.00 it costs, unless you REALLY run out of inspiration.</p>
