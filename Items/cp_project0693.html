<p>William Gibson's <i>Neuromancer</i> is a work that seems to me as a bit ahead of its time. Gibson's unique writing style, invented vocabulary and dark future world all combined to impress me.</p>
<p>I actually had read <i>Neuromancer</i> as an eighth-grader and just thought it was okay. I looked at it with a sort of cynical eye and found Gibson's writing style to be irritating at times. For example, Gibson never physically describes his main character, Case. If he did, I failed to see it. However, other characters are described in detail. I'm a bit more open-minded now to accept this way of character creation. In a sense, Case's looks don't matter -- he's a born cyberspace cowboy in which his appearance doesn't make a difference.</p>
<p>Other elements in <i>Neuromancer</i> serve to distinguish it from the rest of the huge market of science fiction novels. For example, when Case is a rider inside Molly's body, it's a weird experience for the reader. &quot;For a few frightened seconds he fought helplessly to control her body. Then he willed himself into passivity, became the passenger behind her eyes&quot;, Gibson writes. I'm sure this sort of thing has been done before in science fiction novels, but never in this way : a mix of science and magic, almost, allowing Case to experience exactly what Molly is.</p>
<p>Gibson also successfully creates a dark future that would be imitated again and again, just like Tolkien's world of Middle-Earth. I was impressed with the ingenuity of the impossibly huge Sprawl, in which people could take tubes from Baltimore to New York in between lunch and dinner. Animals are long gone -- a rarity (much like Philip K. Dick's <i>Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?</i> novel) vainly attempted to bring back to nature by scientists. The reader knows it's impossible. Gibson also forsees a future of cyborgs much like Mitchell's <i>City of Bits</i> touches on, but in an extreme; young teens sport highly visible &quot;microsoft&quot;, street samurai and &quot;joe boys&quot; have cybernetic weapons, biological mods and synthetic muscle. One would wonder where normal people live in this world. Probably in remote strongholds in the midwest or something.</p>
<p>I also found Gibson's writing style to be interesting -- short, descriptive sentences and tons of words bonded together to seem futuristic. All in all, I enjoyed the book.</p>
