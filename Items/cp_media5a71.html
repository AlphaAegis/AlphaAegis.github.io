<p><span class="r">Overview:</span> This is one of those shows that TOTALLY addicted me to it when it came out. This was the first 3D animation I ever saw, and I must say, I completely fell in love with it. Reboot is a wonderfully intelligent kids show, that for techies, seemed to have all the inside-tech jokes just right. All the characters are inside a computer world - the mainframe, and the good guys are trying to stop the evil virus, Megabyte from infecting the rest of the mainframe.</p>
<p><span class="r">The Bottom Line:</span> Reboot provided us a terrific fantasy view inside a virtual computer. While the first two seasons were fun, season 3 was just terrific! After ABC dropped this Canadian production, they were able to go adult-like, with much darker themes and a really cool sword and sorcery bent. The follow-on movies captured the fun of the first two seasons while keeping the darkness of the third. And while the CG has definitely been surpassed, for some reason, the look still works.</p></div>
