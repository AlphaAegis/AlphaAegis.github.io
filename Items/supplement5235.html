		<h4>Review</h4>
		<p>Original but opportunistic, this supplement introduces a bit of fantasy in Cyberpunk with vampires. Several leads are offered to introduce vampires in rational or fantasy forms depending on what best fits the GM campaign. Unfortunately, the background is a bit light on this level, and instead of providing an in-depth work, the authors preferred to add psychic powers and lycanthropy, the latter not necessarily having a place in a cyberpunk campaign. The White Wolf model not being always good to copy, this supplement which could have been excellent is content to be &quot;not bad&quot;, and it is a pity. It was completed by the supplement Bloodlust.</p>
