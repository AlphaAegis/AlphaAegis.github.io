<h1>Blade Runner</h1>
</center><br>
<div class="c">
<p><i>Blade Runner</i> is a cyberpunk film directed by Ridley Scott. It gave cyberpunk science fiction its visual representation, and has so become &quot;the definitive cyberpunk movie&quot;.</p>
<p>The movie is based on Philip K. Dick's book <i>Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep</i>.</p>
<p><i>Blade Runner</i> is not a traditional sci-fi movie, it's a touching drama about the value of life and the importance of making the most of what you've got. One of the most important themes in the film is the question of what is more valuable - humans without emotions, or machines with ? The film gives no answer, it just opens our eyes and makes us aware that we should be grateful for being alive.</p>
<br>
<h3>Synopsis</h3>
<p>Los Angeles, 2019 : Rick Deckard is a blade runner, a police man of the future who hunts down and terminates replicants, artificially created humans. Replicants were used to serve in the colonies outside Earth but with fixed lifespans. They were declared illegal after a bloody mutiny on an Off-World Colony, and are to be terminated upon detection. Man's obsession with creating a being equal to himself has back-fired.</p>
<p>Deckard wants to get out of the force, but is drawn back in when 5 &quot;skin jobs&quot;, a slang term for replicants, hijack a ship back to Earth. The city that Deckard must search for his prey is a huge, sprawling, bleak vision of the future. This film questions what it is to be human, and why life is so precious.</p>

<dd>American author Philip K. Dick passed away in 1982, the same year that <i>Blade Runner</i>, the adaptation of his novel <i>Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?</i>, was released. As a result he never got to see the full film, but he did manage to catch a glimpse of some scenes on TV, causing him to write this letter to Jeff Walker, the head of the film's marketing crew.</dd></p>
