<p><span class="r">Overview:</span> Cyborg 2, we are led to believe is a sequel to Pyun's Cyborg. I say this because right at the beginning, a cut scene of the cyborg in the first movie is shown. But quickly we learn that this is only shown because Cyborg 2 didn't have the budget to make low quality cyborg FX. In fact, Cyborg 2 has NOTHING to do with the first more. In the first movie, cyborgs were human brains encased in a cybernetic body. In Cyborg 2, cyborgs are robots. Furthermore, in Cyborg, we found a lawless dystopia, yet in Cyborg 2, we find a battle of two mega-corporations.</p>

<p><span class="r">The Story:</span> OK, the story is just hoaky, but unlike Pyun's Cyborg, at least it holds together once you give up on the absurdity of it. In Cyborg 2, the Pinhole corporation has decided to kill off the management of the rival cyborg corporation by embedding one of their androids (called cyborgs) with a special chemical, that, upon orgasm (yes, I guess androids in the future not only have sex, they orgasm!), blows up the chick and everything around it! It turns out they can also use a detonator switch to do explode the androids. So the idea is they will send a hot android chick (played by Angelina Jolie in her debut starring role) to visit a party at the rival corporation and explode! Why don't they just set off a regular bomb there, you ask? Good question! If there's an answer, we aren't given it.</p>

<p>Cash, the hot, sentient android chick (Angelina Jolie), gets word of her new implant by a disembodied mouth (Jack Palance) who tells her Pinwheel's plan for her demise. She and her human lover, Colt (played by Elias Koteas) escape Pinwheel and attempt to escape to a place far off where free cyborgs live in peace with humans. Pinwheel corporation hires a crazed bounty hunter (Billy Drago) to go and retrieve Cash. The rest of the movie is comprised of bizarre chase and confrontation scenes, similar to the first movie, only this time the good guys are on the run.</p>
<p><img src="http://cyberpunk2021.free.fr/images/review/Cyborg_2_04.jpg"></p>
<p><span class="r">The Bottom Line:</span> Schroeder's Cyborg 2 is not a good movie, but in comparing it with Pyun's Cyborg, it does come out better storywise (it's not as good on the fights though). Once you get past the absurdity of the story, things do start to hold together better. On top of this, we get an absolutely gorgeous, young Angelina Jolie kicking ass and even throwing in a nude scene for good measure. Billy Drago provides a memorable performance as a lunatic bad guy, and Palance, if you can get over the close-ups on his disembodied face, is pretty good to see for the brief time he's on. I'd give this 4.5 stars if I had that available, but instead I'm bumping it up to 5 stars both for Angelina Jolie's performance, and the thought they give to how cyborgs and humans could have a life-long love affair.</p></div>
