		<h4>Review</h4>
		<p>Dedicated to rockerboyz and other peoples from the show business scene, this supplement hesitates between the equipment catalog and People magazine. In both cases the result is disappointing and we find ourselves hungry because the content is poor. The chapter on braindance remains, relatively new, but for my part I prefer to be inspired by William Gibson's simstims rather than by what is described here. A supplement that can easily be dispensed with. Better to go directly to his successor : Live & Direct.</p>
