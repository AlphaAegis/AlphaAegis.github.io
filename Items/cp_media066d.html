<h1>Ghost in the Shell</h1>
</center><br>
<div class="c">
<p><i>Ghost in the Shell</i> (Kokaku kidotai) is a cyberpunk anime film by Mamoru Oshii.</p>
<p>The skillful blending of drawn animation and computer-generated imagery excited anime fans when this science fiction mystery was released : many enthusiasts believe Ghost suggests what the future of anime will be, at least in the short term.</p>
<p>Mamoru Oshii directs with a staccato rhythm, alternating sequences of rapid-fire action (car chases, gun battles, explosions) with static dialogue scenes that allow the characters to sort out the vaguely mystical and rather convoluted plot. Kusanagi's final quote from I Corinthians suggests that electronic evolution may compliment and eventually supplant organic evolution.</p>
<br>
<h3>Synopsis</h3>
<p>The year is 2029. The world has become intensively information oriented and humans are well-connected to the network. Crime has developed into a sophisticated stage by hacking into the interactive network. To prevent this, Section 9 is formed. These are cyborgs or &quot;enhanced&quot; humans with incredible strengths and abilities that can access any network on Earth. They are used for undercover work.</p>
<p>One of the key cyborgs is The Major, Motoko Kusanagi, who resembles a cross between The Terminator and a Playboy centerfold. She finds herself caught up in a tangled web of espionage and counterespionage as she searches for the mysterious superhacker known as &quot;The Puppet Master&quot;.</p>
