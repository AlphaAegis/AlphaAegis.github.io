<p><span class="r">Overview:</span> Unlike the tagline (<i>should not be missed...</i>), I think it's quite OK to miss Tetsuo II, especially if you've already seen the real thing. In Tetsuo II, Tsukamoto substitutes a larger budget in lieu of the unique and innovative narrative we find in <a href="http://cyberpunk2021.free.fr/cp_media.php?review&amp;id_media=54&amp;lng=fr">Tetsuo: the Iron Man</a>. The compromise is bad all around. For starters, this style of merging man and machine works FAR better in B&W than it does in color. The surreal believability factor of the FX drops significantly in color. As for the story, the whole idea of centering the conflict around a family setting significantly lessens the power of his earlier story, as does Tsukamoto's attempt to add a more coherent narrative. While his point still seems to be the same one, its told with lots less force, in a far less interesting way, and also in a far less shocking way.</p>
<p><span class="r">The Bottom Line:</span> I can take screencaps of this if anyone is dying to see the visuals (I understand it's out of print), but it's just not a great movie. Tetsuo: Bodyhammer is OK to see this as long as you understand you're getting a Japanese Cyberpunk movies that's far less than Tetsuo - Iron Man, or even less than Rubber's Lover, for that matter. I've heard people comment that Bodyhammer sucks so they aren't interested in seeing the first one - don't buy this reasoning. While the first <i>screams</i> uniqueness, Body Hammer whimpers "<i>cash in on my earlier success by cutting back the edginess and going more mainstream</i>". It even stars Tomorowo Taguchi again, who attempts to reprise the same role and crazed scream faces - only this time it comes across more as the last show in a long day of staged repeat performances, similar to what you might find in a theater act at an amusement park late on a Sunday evening. In that sense, Body Hammer comes off as a sequel in true hollywood style.</p></div>
