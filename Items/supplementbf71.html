		<h4>Review</h4>
		<p>A sequel to the previous volume Media Junkie : Take One, this scenario is actually a succession of themed stories (the first volume contained four, this one contains the other six). An employer wants to retrieve the original soundtracks of some 20th century films, and the PCs' journey to find these films bears a strange resemblance to the scenario of the latter. Here, they will be Nosferatu, Cat People, Invasion of the Body Snatchers, Hellraiser, Alien and Night of the Living Dead. In these scenarios, we oscillate between an ambiguous atmosphere and the supernatural (hello Mr. Werewolf) pure and hard. The GMs will sort it out, I for one would have done without the werewolves. Alternate Reality supplements such as Dark Metropolis, Night's Edge and Grimm's Cybertales are therefore recommended. The advantage of the structure of this scenario is that it can be played as one big campaign, or as several separate short stories.</p>
