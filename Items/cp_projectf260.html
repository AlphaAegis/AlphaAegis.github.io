<b>Unknow</b><br>
<b>23 April 1997</b></center>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div id="data" class="d">
<p>I am the very model of a modern teenage Cyberpunk<br>
I rent my own apartment and it's full of electronic junk<br>
I own a VAX, a 486, I've even got a PDP<br>
I've finished Myst and Doom but I am stumped by Wing Commander III</p>
<p>I'm very well aquainted too with matters pornographical<br>
I have a list of image sites, both overseas and national<br>
So if you want to see a picture of that Anna Nichole Smith<br>
I'll fire up my terminal and fetch for you a naughty GIF</p>
<p>I'm totally an anarchist, the government I'd like to wreck,<br>
Though if they were to get blown up, who'd give to me my welfare cheque ?<br>
In short if you need answers that concern your electronic junk,<br>
I am the very model of a modern teenage Cyberpunk</p>
<p>I know the ancient myths about RTM, Pengo and Mitnick<br>
I 'hack' into computers and I then perform a credit check<br>
I scare all my non-hacker friends with tales of cracker theivery<br>
and even though I'm spouting crap they'll listen and believe in me</p>
<p>I've learned to spot a troll and I've seen flames about the way I spell,<br>
I've traced badly forged cancels and seen napalm poured on AOL<br>
I've laughed at all the newbies and their flailing cries of &quot;You all Suck !&quot;<br>
I've been flamed by Carasso, with an anvil I have then been struck<br>
</p>
<p>I've hung around in alt.tasteless and seen war waged on rec.pets.cats<br>
I've spent my time in talk.bizarre and used those stupid Relay Chats<br>
In short, if you need answers that concern your electronic junk,<br>
I am the very model of a modern teenage Cyberpunk</p>
<p>Well postings like &quot;MAKE.MONEY.FAST&quot;, I am now somewhat wary at,<br>
I have been &quot;Global Killfiled&quot; by the Joel Furr Commissariat,<br>
When rosebud posts a lengthy rant 'bout Microsoft she swears is true,<br>
I know that she is just another short lived kook without a clue</p>
<p>When I have learnt what progress has been made upon the Internet,<br>
When I know something more than just a smattering of netiquette,<br>
In short when I can have a world-wide soapbox on which I can stand<br>
I've got no time for other things, like beer and trips to Disneyland</p>
<p>My life outside the Internet is very very sad you see<br>
I cannot get my spots to fade, my social life's a tragedy,<br>
But still if you need answers that concern your electronic junk,<br>
I am the very model of a modern teenage Cyberpunk.</p>
