	<center><h2>Cyberpunk Cut-and-Paste Manifesto</h2>
<b>Gareth Branwyn</b><br></center>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div id="data" class="d">
<p>What follows is a series of quotes and paraphrases taken from a variety of sources. Some have been &quot;sampled&quot; so many times that their origins (and authors) have been obscured; others you will clearly recognize. Be attentive to the fact that these statements slip back and forth between the two uses of &quot;cyberpunk&quot; (as a literary genre and as a real world subculture). No attempt has been made to clarify their original intent nor to put them in any order.</p>
<p>Sources sampled include <i>The Mirrorshades Anthology</i>, <i>Vague</i> #21 (the Cyberpunk issue), <i>Going Gaga</i> #5, and the <i>Mississippi Review</i> #47/48. The original authors include Bruce Sterling, John Shirley, William Gibson, Mark Downham and Gareth Branwyn.</p>
<br>
<hr><p>Models are not true or false, they are more or less useful.</p>
<p>Cyberpunk is endless skimming.</p>
<br>
<hr><p>Images, electronic continents, drift past the retina, moving towards pure surface. In cyberpunk, the real, the virtual, the imaginal, the artificial, the human and the machine (cyborg) are all seeking re-invention, re-definition. Our vast technological changes are shaping new forms of culture, social organization, and myth-making.</p>
<p>Cyberpunk is about technological implosion, miniaturization, and synaesthetic media.</p>
<br>
<hr><p>Cyberpunk in the real world simply means the Do-It-Yourself attitude coupled with libertarian anarchist politics, projected 20 minutes into the future. It's &quot;garage band&quot; or rebel futurism.</p>
<br>
<hr><p>Cyberpunk is characterized by :</p>
<ul><li>A global worldview.</li>
<li>An identification with underground cultures.</li>
<li>Influences outside of SF.</li>
<li>Punk intensity.</li>
<li>Influences from rock culture.</li>
<li>Anti-heroes as heroes.</li>
<li>Honesty in characterization.</li>
<li>Information saturation/overload.</li>
<li>An interest in body modification.</li>
<li>A romance with electronic forms of &quot;non-ordinary&quot; reality (i.e. &quot;cyberspace&quot;).</li>
<li>An interest in anarchy, libertarianism, cultural terrorism.</li>
</ul><p>&quot;Cyber&quot; and &quot;punk&quot; - the ideal post-modern couple : a machine philosophy that can create the world in its own image and a self-mutilating freedom, that is that image snarling back.</p>
<br>
<hr><p>Cyberpunk reflects the increasingly pervasive influence of science fiction on post-modern culture - the moment when SF depicts the collapse of the future onto the present.</p>
<p>Cyberpunk deals increasingly with madness, more precisely with the most philosophically interesting phenomenon of madness : hallucination (derangement).</p>
<br>
<hr><p>We are very quickly entering a world where the difference between fantasy and reality is difficult or impossible to distinguish. It is a globalized world pulsing with information flows and data commodities, a place where infinite sub-cultures and mind cults live in their own pocket universes.</p>
<p>Cyberpunk is an industrial myth of the near future, a new techno-surreal fiction.</p>
<br>
<hr><p>Cyberpunk is a scrambled mass of referential fictions in search of an operational strategy for the living of life, which is increasingly experiencing slippage into the virtual technologies of the near future.</p>
<br>
<hr><p>The real is leaking into the representational.</p>
<br>
<hr><p>Cyberpunk attempts to demythologize the established cultural codes in order to decipher concealed strategies of domination, desire, will, power, and the will to power.</p>
<br>
<hr><p>Cyberpunk is a radical interrogation of the technologies at work in contemporary society.</p>
<p>Cyberpunk is an interzone between hard technologies, the sciences, mysticism and nihilo-romantic surreality. Cyberpunk has a strong garage band aesthetic. It grapples with the raw core of our near future, its myths, its ideas, its coming practices. It is a pop culture which is theorizing itself into a more cohesive and self-determined existence.</p>
<br>
<hr><p>The differences between the sciences and the humanities : the gulf between literary culture, the formal structures of art and politics and the culture of science, the world of science and engineering - it's all converging. Cyberpunk intuitively understands that technical culture is moving very fast. 95% of the political Left is thirty years behind this techno-convergence, and receding. The advances of science are deeply radical - potentially revolutionary even, if utilized appropriately. They are surging into the culture at large; they are invasive.</p>
<br>
<hr><p>Certain central themes spring up repeatedly in cyberpunk. Firstly the theme of body invasion, prosthetic limbs, implanted circuitry, cosmetic surgery, genetic alteration. Secondly, mind invasion and mind expansion : brain-computer interfaces, artificial intelligence, neurochemistry - all techniques radically redefining the nature of humanity, the nature of self. For cyberpunk, the computer is much more than an object; it is also an icon and a metaphor that suggests new ways of thinking about ourselves and our new environments, new ways of constructing images of what it means to be human.</p>
<br>
<hr><p>The technical revolution reshaping our society is based not in hierarchy but in decentralization, not in rigidity, but in fluidity.</p>
<br>
<hr><p>In cyberpunk, geographical frontiers no longer exist and in their place are vast micro-electronic territories. One of the key roles of the expanding electronic information grid is to articulate a new social and geopolitical stratification based on the immediate access to data. The aim of cyberpunk is to create a state of temporary grid-lock in order to insert subversive messages of its own. Information, structured by automatic data processing, becomes a new type of raw material for the (post) industrial myths of the near future.</p>
<br>
<hr><p>The street finds its own use for things. It's all in the mix.</p>
<ul><li>Information wants to be free.</li>
<li>Access to computers and anything which may teach you something about how the world works should be unlimited and total.</li>
<li>Always yield to the hands-on imperative.</li>
<li>Mistrust Authority.</li>
<li>Promote Decentralization.</li>
<li>Do It Yourself.</li>
<li>Fight the Power.</li>
<li>Feed the noise back into the system.</li>
</ul></div><br>
