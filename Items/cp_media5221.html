<p><span class="r">Overview:</span> Few would consider Singapore to be the home of cutting-edge science fiction and even less would be swayed by the island nation's first science fiction film, Avatar (or Cyber Wars). The first forty minutes are cringe-worthy; poorly constructed characters, dodgy VFX and some of the worst dialogue outside a Ishiro Honda film are likely to put many viewers off straight away. However, Avatar offers a little more than your cookie-cutter tale of good vs. evil wrapped in a sleek (if not cardboard-like) sci-fi setting. Transhumanism, corporate greed, social engineering, cheating death ? all feature in an interesting little science fiction romp that unfortunately suffers from a very limited budget. Our story begins...</p>
<p><img src="http://cyberpunk2021.free.fr/images/review/Cyber_Wars_03.jpg"></p>
<p><span class="r">Synopsis:</span> In the early 21st century, the entire free world is connected through the CyberLink (think "internet meets cyberspace"), the backbone of all communication and financial trading (ie. the stock exchange). The influence of the CyberLink is most felt in the city-state of Sintawan, a sprawling metropolis where corporate greed and personal gain rise above all else. Men (and women) such as Joseph Lau (David Warner, ladies and gentlemen!) are practically Gods over their own domain, the CyberLink ensuring their continued dominance over Sintawan through the megacorporations. Five megacorporations in particular ? one of which is owned by Lau - appear locked in an epic game of wits with the people of Sintawan as the chess pieces.</p>

<p>Not that the people actually realize this, oh no. They are too busy with their own private agendas to even notice! Although a vast majority of CyberLink users are legitimate, illegal users do exist and often use "SIMPLANTS" to hide their true identities (sort of like using a disguise and a false ID). "SIMPLANT"-users are often tracked down by freelance bounty hunters such as Dash MacKenzie (O'Reilly) or, more commonly, by Ident cops such as Detective Vic Huang. Dash is contacted by Joseph Lau ? as are the Ident Police ? to track down an illegal "SIMPLANT"-user, Edward Chang. It seems straightforward enough, until Dash and Detective Huang discover a massive conspiracy involving the CyberLink, Joseph Lau and the other megacorporations. This game just got deadly...</p>

<p><span class="r">Analysis:</span> To be frank, Avatar is hardly "award-winning entertainment" (though apparently it has already picked up two at a Spanish film festival) and will not blow anyone's socks off. It is not destined to become a sci-fi classic or even a cult film, and is likely already forgotten by those that noticed it to begin with. Though it is not without its merits; the technology is fantastic: holograms are often used to hide the truth (such as disguising the fact that a prominent, five-star hotel is in desperate need of an exterminator and a few coats of paint), handheld communicators for video calls, micro-scale robots disguised as insects (such as beetles and dragonflies) that are used to project holograms and undertake surveillance, the concept of people that live inside the CyberLink and those that have augmented their bodies with technology (such as my friend below)... it is absolutely incredible that so much was achieved on such a limited budget.</p>
<p><img src="http://cyberpunk2021.free.fr/images/review/Cyber_Wars_06.jpg"></p>
<p><span class="r">Cyberpunk Musings:</span> There are a number of interesting aspects of Avatar which benefit from further exploration.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Ravers:</b> Ravers are part of Sintawan's subculture. Augmented human beings with a gang mentality, they are fiercely anti-corporate and anti-government. Ravers are all connected through a telepathic link-up that is separate from the CyberLink and frequently use "crash-bangs" (handheld electromagnetic pulse devices) to damage the city-state's infrastructure (ie. at one point in the film an organised group of ravers attempt to take down Sintawan's mass transit system and partly succeed). All appear to have the same "left-brain implants" that have an almost "retro" feel to them. Possibly the coolest part of the film.</li>
<li><b>City-states:</b> There already exists cities with populations and gross domestic products (GDPs) greater than that of most third- and second-world countries. Sintawan appears to be governed by an organisation similar to the United Nations, though the corporations have been challenging this seat of power for some time. It is not too far fetched to stipulate that a large enough city (such as New York) could break off from the mainland and declare itself an independent state in the near future.</li>
<li><b>Avatars/Holograms:</b> Though never referred to as "holograms" as such, these feature predominantly in the film. For example, one of the corporate heads is suffering from terminal cancer and has had his body put in a state of hibernation. His mind, however, remains fully function and an "avatar" (a holographic representation of him) continues to act as the functioning head of the corporation, albeit only within the confines of his office. As mentioned before, holograms are also used to "cloak" certain objects and sometimes create very believable deceptions (such as the six-star hotel).</li>
<li><b>Surveillance and "Bugging":</b> Mini-robots disguised as very believable imitations of dragonflies (and to a lesser extent, beetles) are used throughout the film for audio and visual surveillance and the projecting of holograms. If you think that you have been "bugged", then you are probably right!</li>
<li><b>The Spirit and the Flesh:</b> Several characters (and one in particular) practically live inside the CyberLink. One such character's body is a complete mess (he is severely overweight and is always "jacked in") while his "spirit" seems almost free within the virtual confines of the CyberLink. The CyberLink also offers a sort of perpetual "afterlife" for those who have died in the real world (much like Armin Mueller-Stahl's character in The Thirteenth Floor).</li>
<li><b>Social Engineering:</b> Suppose that chaos theory is true; that every action and every decision radiates outwards and has an effect on other things and other actions and other decisions, exponentially increasing as it pushes out. Now suppose that chaos theory is somehow controlled. That someone higher up is pushing all the buttons, willing us into certain actions and certain decisions that is slowly shaping our culture. Now imagine that person "higher up" is one of five corporate heads, who are all out to win a game of wits with human beings as the game pieces. Scary, no? This is the BIG issue in Avatar, and the one that ninety percent of the film is structured around. So what if the game has brought great prosperity to the people of Sintawan; it's still motivated by greed, is it not? Is destroying the game worth the cost destroying modern society? You decide.</li>
</ul>

<p><span class="r">The Bottom Line:</span> If you watch this film as I did ? whereby I was expecting your typical, low-budget sci-fi action romp ? then you might be pleasantly surprised. Though not that greatly. Avatar is a film possibly best suited to die-hard sci-fi fans with no sense of taste (like moi) and who are easily impressed by a few interesting ideas and flashy set pieces (also like moi). Otherwise, steer clear and stick to the bane of "thinking-man's science fiction" (yes, I am referring to The Matrix sequels). Avatar has plenty of ideas, though permitting it any more than six stars would be a crime and an insult. The bottom line: CONSUME AT YOUR OWN RISK.</p></div>
