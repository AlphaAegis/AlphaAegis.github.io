<h1>The Difference Engine</h1>
</center><br>
<div class="c">
<p><i>The Difference Engine</i> is more like &quot;steampunk&quot; than real cyberpunk, because it's located in an alternative past, in Victorian England.</p>
<br>
<h3>Synopsis</h3>
<p>The year is 1855. London. The city swelters in a poisonous heatwave.</p>
<p>The computer age has arrived a century ahead of time, with Charles Babbage's perfection of his Analytical Engine. The Industrial Revolution, supercharged by the development of steam-driven cybernetic engines, is in full and drastic swing. Great Britain, with her calculating-cannons, steam dreadnoughts, machine guns and information technology, prepares to better the world's lot...</p>
<p>Sybil Gerard, ruined woman, politician's tart, daughter of a notorious Luddite; Edward Mallory, explorer, palaeontologist, the discoverer of the famed Land Leviathan; Lady Ada Byron, daughter of the Prime Minister, mathematical genius, compulsive gambler, the Queen of Engines; these three and many others are unwitting participants in a conspiracy linking Great Britain with the France of Louis Napoleon and the Manhattan commune of Karl Marx.</p>
