<img src="interface/bioworks.png" align="left" style="padding-right:10"><h3>History</h3>
<p>It all started in 1996, the first sheep was cloned, from that point on, BioWorks was there, pushing the limits of biological engineering. In 2012, their first creation walked out of the lab, the ultimate warrior, part human, part tiger. Their creation went crazy and several reporters were killed, many more were injured. It has been eight years since that fateful day, and now they are ready to reintroduce to the world what improvements they have made. Creatures made-to-order, anything will be possible they say.</p>

<h3>Legalities</h3>
<p>In 2013, the federal courts made a ruling that these creatures &quot;being made and not part of nature have no rights offered to them except for those predetermined by previous laws accorded to the treatment of animals&quot;.</p>

<h3>Building the Perfect Beast</h3>
<p>All constructs begin life as a human &quot;blank&quot;, a preprogrammed body grown from stem cells, that the animal's DNA building blocks are added to.</p>
<p>The process starts when the client orders a construct. An administrative engineer walks through the process with the client describing each option that is available for the construct. From that phase the construct is designed in a laboratory by splicing the DNA strands together, weaving the traits desired into the new creation.</p>
<p>When the construct starts out the blank is almost human. It's through the manipulation of the genes that the animal characteristics begin to appear. Once the proper DNA cocktail has been mixed it is injected into the &quot;blank&quot;, then the whole construct is placed in a large container called the &quot;birthing vat&quot; which is filled with amino acids, liquid proteins and other nutrients similar to those found in a mother's womb.</p>
<p>The entire process, once the details of the construct are ironed out, takes 5 days, however the construct doesn't reach maturity until a year later. After a month the construct can begin an accelerated training program, which will prepare it for its life outside of the lab. The resulting creatures end up with the abilities and instincts of the Animal, and the learning capabilities of the Human.</p>

<h3>The Rules</h3>
<ol>
<li>Since they are not quite human to begin with, any cybernetics cost <b>double</b> the H.L. (in other words, you are making an animal a human, then changing it into a machine).</li>
<li>Since these creatures reach maturity in just over a year, they will also grow old faster, figure 7 years per 1 human.</li>
<li>If &quot;Player Character&quot; is not working for a corp (or the person that purchased the PC), the background will have to reflect one of three things, escape, buy-out, or release of contract.</li>
<li>Because of this, the background and starting equipment / ruro will be determined by the GM.</li>
<li>Most of the animal types here (90%) will end up as solo material, usually ending up in some corporate war someplace. Other options include corporate espionage, assassination, scouting & security (see &quot;Education/Training (Roles)&quot; below).</li>
<li>Each construct costs around 30,000 with &quot;extraordinary&quot; beings (PCs) costing 2 to 3 times that much.</li>
<li>EMP is the most important stat of the construct, it is also the hardest to come by. Starting Characters pay <b>double</b> for their initial EMP stat (max of 5). This may be increased two ways : through therapy, they may increase it by +3. At the cost of BioPoints, the constructs EMP may be increased to a maximum of 10.</li>
<li>All beings will be designed using BioPoints for game balance. Below are the costs associated with the various options available for vat grown beings : each character begins with 30 BioPoints.</li>
</ol>

<div class="c"><h3>Bestial Disadvantages</h3>
<p>There is a way to acquire more BioPoints to build your construct, which is by adding in bestial disadvantages. These disdavantages are traded off one-for-one with BioPoints. They can be physical and/or psychological but there is usually a price to be paid for these disadvantages however in terms of Humanity Loss. Abilities minus disadvantages cannot total more the 30 points.</p></div>

</table>
<div class="c"><h3>Appearance</h3>
<p>There are three basic &quot;forms&quot; a construct can take : Animal, Beast-Man and Human.</p>
<ul>
<li>Animal is just like it sounds, every feature of the animal remains as it did in its natural form. Obviously they may be designed bigger faster and smarter, but outside appearances appear normal.</li>
<li>Beast-Man, not human and not animal, but somewhere in-between, this can be anywhere to a human body with a wolf head and large claws to something milder like a construct that looks almost human with a raccoon mask.</li>
<li>Human, with the possible exception of claws there is very little to differentiate, physically, between these characters and a normal human.</li>
</ul>
<p>Even if the construct has no apparent physical differences from its human counterparts, like claws or horns, certain genetic traits common with the base animal will still show through.</p>
<ul>
<li>Bovine : soft eyes, rounded facial features.</li>
<li>Canine : large chest (if appropriate for the breed), very expressive eyes.</li>
<li>Felines : sharp cheekbones, light brown or green eyes, slightly pointed ears.</li>
<li>Rodent : sharp features, large eyes.</li>
</ul>
<p>Currently, the constructs being manufactured are not of mixed types, this is being tested at the moment. Because of the physiological make up of the constructs, Avians, Reptiles and Amphibians are not possible.</p>
<br>
<h3>Education/Training (Roles)</h3>
<p>Because of their corporate origins, most BioWorks creations are be built to benefit the corporation that ordered it in some major capacity. Listed below is a list of Roles that offer the best fit in a corperate atmosphere.</p>
<b>Security/Front Line</b>
<ul>
<li>Solo</li>
<li>Body Guard</li>

<li>Sniper</li>
</ul>

<b>Espionage</b>
<ul>
<li>Information Runner</li>
<li>Prowler</li>
<li>Recon/Scout</li>
<li>Smuggler</li>
</ul>

<b>Deep Space/Hard Labor</b>
<ul>
<li>Salver</li>
<li>Jockey</li>
<li>Highrider</li>
<li>Workganger</li>
</ul>

<b>Playbeings/Entertainment</b>
