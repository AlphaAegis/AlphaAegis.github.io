		<h4>Review</h4>
		<p>Here is a recent scenario from AG. A little voluminous than its predecessors, and rather honest in its presentation, this is surprising. On closer inspection, it's a fairly classic action/scenario, but set in Alaska, which makes it original. Moreover, additional rules are provided to simulate the effects of cold, and to inform about the equipment used in this kind of environment. Scenario documentation is unusually important according to AG criteria, and plans, as well as geographical and personal information about the NPCs are provided. Proof that if AG wanted to, they wouldn't just do crap...</p>
