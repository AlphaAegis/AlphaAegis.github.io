		<h4>Review</h4>
		<p>Maximum Metal lives up to its name. Indeed, it is a question of expanding the rules concerning vehicles for CP2020. In addition to this, this supplement focuses on military vehicles in particular, which may not be of much interest to the GM as it does not want to turn its psychological investigation campaign into a battlefield. This supplement introduces ACPA (Assisted Combat Powered Armor, equivalent to Japanese landmates) and a certain amount of heavy weaponry. In addition to the rules for building one's own vehicles and ACPA, which unfortunately contain some inconsistencies, the supplement offers a large catalog of military vehicles. Too bad not all of them are illustrated, but those that are, are good. There are also some optional rules for large-scale vehicle combat. In summary, the quality of this supplement is good, and the proposed rules are interesting, but it should be noted that the material presented is military, and therefore may not be intended for daily use in the game.</p>
