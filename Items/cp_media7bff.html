<p><span class="r">Overview:</span> WTF!!! That pretty much sums up Sixteen Tongues. This low-budget softcore cyberpunk porn flick has potential in some of its thoughts, but just loses out in editing, movie making basics like clear dialogue and pointless filler scenes. Low budget flicks often free the director to stop paying attention to movie conventions and potentially create something unique. But to make this pay off, some of the basics of crafting still need to be worked.</p>
<p><img src="http://cyberpunk2021.free.fr/images/review/Sixteen_Tongues_02.jpg"></p>
<p><span class="r">The Story:</span> In a dystopic, seedy future, where humanity is fleeting, Sitxteen Tongues follows the plight of three emotionally scarred people (one physically scarred as well). Adrian (Crawford James) is a severely scarred police officer who seemingly died in a previous conflict, but was brought back to life, and had his damaged skin repaired by replacing it with sixteen tongues. His tongue skin, which forces him to taste his own clothes and everything he touches, has since made him go crazy ? he hears voices and every now and then, and randomly goes on murderous rampages. Ginny Chin-Chin is a bio-modified assassin droid who has had sexual implants causing her to organism every time she blinks her eyes. The implants help her resist the urges to kill, but she still is driven to find her maker and rip him into shreds. Alik is a hacker extraordinaire, and is Ginny's lover. She spends her time trying to find Ginny's maker, but also has the ability to user her equipment to ghost-hack into other's minds.</p>
<p><img src="http://cyberpunk2021.free.fr/images/review/Sixteen_Tongues_03.jpg"></p>
<p>All three characters are emotionally traumatized. Alik and Ginny spend half the movie fighting about whether they really care for one another. Adrian is caught up in his own paranoid delusions. Through a chance encounter to get ice, Ginny and Adrian meet up. Ginny goes to his room (which has porno films playing non-stop) and finds out he's a cop. She thinks he can help her in finding her maker, so she gives him oral favors in exchange for potentially helping her. While Ginny is having sex with Adrian, Alik hacks into Adrian's TV signal and watches them. More arguments ensue.</p>
<p><img src="http://cyberpunk2021.free.fr/images/review/Sixteen_Tongues_04.jpg"></p>
<p>Eventually things come to a head due to Adrian's paranoid delusions. In scanning Ginny's bar-code, he knows she is a dangerous murderer, and for some reason, begins to think Ginny is actually responsible for his murderous rampages. Confrontations occur, and things spiral out of control from there.</p>
<p><img src="http://cyberpunk2021.free.fr/images/review/Sixteen_Tongues_05.jpg"></p>
<p><span class="r">The Set:</span> The entire movie takes place in a few rooms in a seedy hotel with porn posters covering all the walls. The hotels don't look at all futuristic, aside for the credit card swap machines everywhere. They do at least look very seedy and lived in, although the random people sleeping on the floor was probably overkill. Also, we eventually learn that complete sexual deviants fill virtually every hotel room.</p>
<p><img src="http://cyberpunk2021.free.fr/images/review/Sixteen_Tongues_06.jpg"></p>
<p><span class="r">The Nudity:</span> Fair warning ? Ginny Chin-Chin spends well over half the movie either in the buff, in a sheer shower-stall plastic outfit, or in her fishnet get-up. She definitely looks hawt in this, whereas Alik, also nude some of the time, is made to look as nerdy as possible. In addition, we are treated to other random nude chicks we see as the movie progresses. Blood and gore are also in high supply here.</p>
<p><img src="http://cyberpunk2021.free.fr/images/review/Sixteen_Tongues_07.jpg"></p>
<p><span class="r">The Props:</span> While at first glance, this movie borders on hard core by having an oral sex scene, if you look closely (or watch the extras), you can see that this is a prop. The dildo prop has various warts on it and spurts blood. Adrian's facial skin grafts look pretty cool, and generally look like a part of him. Alik's hacker tools, while extremely low-tech, at least pass some minor degree of believability.</p>
<p><img src="http://cyberpunk2021.free.fr/images/review/Sixteen_Tongues_08.jpg"></p>
<p><span class="r">The Sound and Lighting:</span> If there's a place that Sixteen Tongues falls flat on it's face, it's the sound. The actors are clearly not that experienced, and tend to mumble their lines. Worse, McCrae, the director, doesn't seem to mind. With this combination of poor quality sound reproduction and mumbled lines, the viewer is left to decipher the dialogue in many of the scenes by watching reactions. Adrian and Alik are the worst at this. There are a few scenes of each where the view has no possibility of figuring out what is said. The lighting is also atrocious. Constantly we get over-exposed actors or actors completely blotted out by a bright light behind them.</p>
<p><img src="http://cyberpunk2021.free.fr/images/review/Sixteen_Tongues_09.jpg"></p>
<p><span class="r">The Bottom Line:</span> Some of the ideas with Sixteen Tongues are pretty interesting. The hacker approach is very similar in some ways to Neuromancer in that it really doesn't seem to recognize a modern internet, but instead goes towards this almost inaccessible cyberspace that only specialized hackers can use. Unfortunately, some ideas, including the Android assassin bit, and the briefly mentioned bacteria-taking over the body and mind bit are barely even explain. While the plot is problematic and the acting sub-par, it's the basics ? lighting, editing and sound that really doom Sixteen Tongues. Again though, Jane Chase as Ginny Chin-Chin does look pretty smokin in her various get-ups. So if you want to see a bizarre, edgy, low-budget approach to cyberpunk with lots of nudity and gross scenes sprinkled throughout, you might get some enjoyment out of this.</p></div>
