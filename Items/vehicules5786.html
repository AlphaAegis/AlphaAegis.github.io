<h3>HOVERCRAFTS</h3>
<p>Hovercraft have their uses. They're faster than anything else on the ground (except rockets and dragsters) and they have no problems with land/water interface, since they can drive right off the water and right onto the beach. Militarily, that ends their usefulness, they can't traverse wooded or rough terrain, their lack of manoeuvrability makes trucks look graceful, they're too lightweight to haul much armor or weaponry, they eat a lot of fuel, and they make a lot of noise. In addition, in dusty conditions, a hover kicks up a lot of dust; you can see it miles off. The same wind blast makes smoke dispensers useless with hovers.<br>&quot;Panzers&quot;, armored fast hovercraft, are popular with some mercenary units and smugglers. Introduced by the Navy as hovercraft gunships, they accompanied the Marine Corps landing hovers onto the beach and inland to provide some fire support. Off the beach, their abilities became apparent, and when the military was reduced in force, a lot of panzers were dropped with them. Many of them went to National Guard and Coast Guard units, where they served well in the Gulf of Mexico and on the Mississippi.</p>
