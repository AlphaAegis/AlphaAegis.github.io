<h1>Pat Cadigan</h1>
</center><br>
<div class="c">
<p>Cyberpunk author Pat Cadigan was born 1954 in Schenectady, New York, United States. She grew up in Fitchburg, Massachusetts. She attended the University of Massachusetts (Amherst, Massachusetts) on a scholarship, majoring in theater, and graduated from the University of Kansas in 1975.</p>
<p>She became a full-time writer in 1987. She has won a World Fantasy Award and the 1988 Locus Award [for her short story <i>Angel</i>, included in <i>Patterns</i>], and she has several times been a finalist for the Hugo Award as well as the Nebula. Her first novel, <i>Mindplayers</i>, was nominated for the Philip K. Dick Memorial Award. <i>Patterns</i>, her short fiction collection, won the 1990 Locus Award for best short-story collection, and was nominated for the Bram Stoker and the Thorpe Menn Awards.</p>
<p>Pat Cadigan's short fiction has appeared in various publications, including <i>Omni</i> and <i>Isaac Asimov's Science Fiction Magazine</i> and in many anthologies. Her work has been translated into French, German, Polish, Japanese and Czech.</p>
<p>Cadigan's work has shown wide variety, ranging through dark fantasy and horror to quirky and original science fiction. Her style is often marked by a tough-minded vigor and icy undercurrents of black humor -- an Eighties sensibility that can only be called punk. Her &quot;Pathosfinder series&quot; (including such stories as <i>Nearly Departed</i>) was remarkable for its eerily visionary air. Cadigan's multifaceted talent includes a strong gift for definitive hard-core cyberpunk.</p>
