<div class="t">
<p><span class="r">Overview:</span> Of all the movies I uncovered during my research for this list, Hardware far and above tops the list of movies I previously had no knowledge of. Put simply, Hardware is absolutely AWESOME low budget cinema. This cross between Alien and the Terminator is set in a totally weird cyberpunk dystopia. It's scary as shit, it's totally weird, and DAMN it's good!</p>
<p><img src="images/review/Hardware_01.jpg"></p>
<p>Filmed for only one million dollars, Hardware takes place in a truly bizarre dystopic future where a nomadic &quot;parts&quot; scavenger goes into a barren wasteland called the &quot;zone&quot; and finds a strange and seemingly valuable robot head and body parts. Through unfortuitous circumstances, this head finds its way back to a hot looking babe named Jill, an artsy-fartsy type (played wonderfully by Stacey Travis) who accepts it as a gift. She decorates the head with cool colors and stuff and sticks it on her shelf.</p>
<p><img src="images/review/Hardware_02.jpg"></p>
<p>Unfortunately for her, it turns out this head and body parts make up the bulk of the government's new prototype Mark-13 droid - a true killer designed to weed out excess population, that's impervious to almost everything. Once this thing re-assembles itself, this thing begins its killing spree. On top of this, Hardware has some of the most eclectic collection of characters ever assembled. We have a totally slimy pervert that spends his time peeking in on Jill, especially when she's in the nude; we have a completely shady parts dealer, we have a zen-like unknown nomad, we have a completely weird boyfriend's sidekick, and some truly bizarre apartment tenants.</p>
<p><img src="images/review/Hardware_03.jpg"></p>
<p><span class="r">The Visuals:</span> Like most cyberpunk films, there is one color that dominates the screen - in this case its orange. We get orange EVERYWHERE, along with a nice few accents of pale yellow. All the set pieces are totally futuristic and hip. We get fun advertisements on the radio, a totally hip atmosphere, and truly, one of the best soundtracks found in movies. Quite simply, Hardware ROCKS!</p>
<p><img src="images/review/Hardware_04.jpg"></p>
<p>Now for the bad news - unless you're in region 2, you're screwed. I picked up a used VHS for about 17 bucks on ebay but still found it worth it. Unfortunately, this version is panned and scanned and cut. If I had obtained a &quot;real&quot; version of this movie, no doubt it would be sitting in my top 10.</p>
<p><img src="images/review/Hardware_05.jpg"></p>
<p><span class="r">The Bottom Line:</span> Hardware is a terrific, low-budget cyberpunk flick - one of the best low budget cyberpunk movies ever. If you are looking for a great, futuristic terminator-style chase movie that takes place almost completely in a bizarre apartment building, this is your movie!</p></div>
