<p><i>Cypher</i> is a corporate world movie, emphasing on some futuristic espionage technologies and SECteam battle tactics.</p>
<br>
<h3>Synopsis</h3>
<p>In a world controlled by corporate law and misinformation, wars have taken a new frontier. So did the espionage. Digicorp has the most strict security, its employees must pass a deep mind security test to be hired, and all that done out of fear of espionage. But Digicorp itself holds the lead in creating corporate spies, by brainwashing its employees, giving them new identities and sending them out to spy on other corporations. In this world, if you want to work for Digicorp, you must be willing, to give up your life, your home and even your wife.</p>
