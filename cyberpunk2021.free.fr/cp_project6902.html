<div id="data" class="d">
<p>In the early spring of 1980 I wrote a little story about a bunch of teenage hackers. From the very first draft this story had a name, and lo, the name was --</p>
<p align="center">CYBERPUNK</p>
<p>And you can bet any body part you'd care to name that, had I had even the slightest least inkling of a clue that I would still be answering questions about this word nearly <i>18 years</i> later, I would have bloody well <b>trademarked</b> the damned thing !</p>
<p>Nonetheless, I didn't, and as you're probably aware, the c-word has gone on to have a fascinating career all its own. At this late date I am not trying to claim unwarranted credit or tarnish anyone else's glory (frankly, I'd much rather people were paying attention to what I'm writing <i>now</i>). But for those folks who are obsessed with history, here, in tightly encapsulated form, is the story behind the story.</p>
<p>The invention of the c-word was a conscious and deliberate act of creation on my part. I wrote the story in the early spring of 1980, and from the very first draft, it was titled &quot;Cyberpunk&quot;. In calling it that, I was actively <i>trying</i> to invent a new term that grokked the juxtaposition of punk attitudes and high technology. My reasons for doing so were purely selfish and market-driven : I wanted to give my story a snappy, one-word title that editors would remember.</p>
<p>Offhand, I'd say I succeeded.</p>
<p>How did I actually create the word ? The way any new word comes into being, I guess : through synthesis. I took a handful of roots --cyber, techno, et al-- mixed them up with a bunch of terms for socially misdirected youth, and tried out the various combinations until one just plain sounded right.</p>
<p>IMPORTANT POINT ! I never claimed to have invented cyberpunk <i>fiction</i> ! That honor belongs primarily to William Gibson, whose 1984 novel, <i>Neuromancer</i>, was the real defining work of &quot;The Movement&quot; (at the time, Mike Swanwick argued that the movement writers should properly be termed <i>neuromantics</i>, since so much of what they were doing was clearly imitation <i>Neuromancer</i>).</p>
<p>Then again, Gibson shouldn't get sole credit either. Pat Cadigan (&quot;Pretty Boy Crossover&quot;), Rudy Rucker (<i>Software</i>), W.T. Quick (<i>Dreams of Flesh and Sand</i>), Greg Bear (<i>Blood Music</i>), Walter Jon Williams (<i>Hardwired</i>), Michael Swanwick (<i>Vacuum Flowers</i>)...the list of early '80s writers who made important contributions towards defining the trope defies my ability to remember their names. Nor was it an immaculate conception : John Brunner (<i>Shockwave Rider</i>), Anthony Burgess (<i>A Clockwork Orange</i>), and perhaps even Alfred Bester (<i>The Stars My Destination</i>) all were important antecedents of the thing that became known as cyberpunk fiction.</p>
<p>Me ? I've been told that my main contribution was inventing the stereotype of the punk hacker with a mohawk. That, and I <i>named</i> the beast, of course.</p>
