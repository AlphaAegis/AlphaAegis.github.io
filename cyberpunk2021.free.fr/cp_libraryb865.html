<h1>Mona Lisa Overdrive</h1>
</center><br>
<div class="c">
<p><i>Mona Lisa Overdrive</i> is the final part of Gibson's loosely-related &quot;Sprawl&quot; trilogy of novels. It's set in the same near-future world as its predecessors <i>Neuromancer</i> and <i>Count Zero</i>.</p>
<br>
<h3>Synopsis</h3>
<p>Into the cyber-hip world of William Gibson comes Mona, a young girl with a murky past and an uncertain future whose life is on a collision course with internationally famous Sense/Net star Angie Mitchell. Since childhood, Angie has been able to tap into cyberspace without a computer. Now, from inside cyberspace, a kidnapping plot is masterminded by a phantom entity who has plans for Mona, Angie, and all humanity, plans that cannot be controlled... or even known. And behind the intrigue lurks the shadowy Yakuza, the powerful Japanese underworld, whose leaders ruthlessly manipulate people and events to suit their own purposes.</p>
