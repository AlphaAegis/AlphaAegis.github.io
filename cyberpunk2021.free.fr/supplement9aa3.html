		<h4>Review</h4>
		<p>A nod to the famous American magazine &quot;Soldier of Fortune&quot; dedicated to mercenaries of all kinds, Solo of Fortune is more or less of the same type : weapons files written by &quot;experts&quot; (in this case misinformed people), advertisements on cybernetics, job offers. Fans will spot Mike and his buddies' private jokes about blackops in the Bay Area. As for the others, they will be very disappointed by a supplement of very poor quality. There will always be a few interesting things to pick up : new implants, guns, solo specialization, rules about cyberpsychosis, gangs, vehicles... All this is unfortunately of very poor quality and originally intended for CP2013. To consult possibly, but above all, do not buy it.</p>
