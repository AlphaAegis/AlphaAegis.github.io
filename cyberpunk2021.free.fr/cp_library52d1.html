<h1>Burning Chrome</h1>

<div class="c">
<p>Burning Chrome is a collection of ten Gibson's short stories, ranging from conventional science fiction to cyberpunk novellas of the &quot;Sprawl&quot; series. Stories include, among others, <i>Johnny Mnemonic</i>, <i>Burning Chrome</i> and <i>Dogfight</i>. With their vividly human characters and their remorseless, hot-wired futures, these stories are simultaneously science fiction at its sharpest and instantly recognizable Polaroids of the postmodern condition.</p>
<p>Gibson's screenplay for the <i>Johnny Mnemonic</i> movie was later released as a separate book.</p>

<h3>Synopsis</h3>
<p><b>Burning Chrome</b> :</p>
<p>Chrome was a streetwise hi-tech whore who cooked up her own custom variation cancers for customers who annoyed her - until somebody got annoyed with her... It might have been in Club Justine, or Jimbo's, or Sad Jacks ot the Rafters; Coretti could never be sure where he'd first seen her. At any time, she might have been in any one of those bars. She swam through the submarine half-life of bottles and glassware and the slow swirl of cigarette smoke... she moved through the natural element, one bar after another. Now, Coretti remembered their first meeting as if he saw it through the wrong end of a powerful telescope, small and clear and very far away...</p>
