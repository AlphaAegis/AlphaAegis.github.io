<h1>In the Beginning... was the Command Line</h1>
</center><br>
<div class="c">
<p>The book discusses the past and future of personal computer operating systems. &quot;It is the fate of manufactured goods to slowly and gently depreciate as they get old&quot;, he writes, &quot;but it is the fate of operating systems to become free&quot;. While others in the computer industry express similarly dogmatic statements, Stephenson charms the reader into his way of thinking, providing anecdotes and examples that turn the pages for you.</p>
<p>Within <i>Command Line</i> Stephenson convincingly encourages us as a society to examine the metaphors of technology -- simplifications that aren't really much simpler -- that we greedily accept.</p>
<p>The idea for this essay began online, when a shortened version of it was posted on Slashdot.org. The book still holds some marks of an e-mail flame gone awry, and some tangents should have been edited to hone his formidable arguments. But unlike similar writers who also discuss technical topics, he doesn't write to exclude; readers who appreciate computing history (like <i>Dealers of Lightning</i> or <i>Fire in the Valley</i>) can easily step into this book.</p>
<p>Stephenson tackles many myths about industry giants in this volume, specifically Apple and Microsoft. By now, every newspaper reader has heard of Microsoft's overbearing business practices, but Stephenson cuts to the heart of new issues for the software giant with a finely sharpened steel blade. Apple fares only a little better as Stephenson (a former Mac user himself) highlights the early steps the company took to prepare for a monopoly within the computer market -- and its surprise when this didn't materialize. Linux culture gets a thorough -- but fair -- skewering, and the strengths of BeOS are touted (although no operating system is nearly close enough to perfection in Stephenson's eyes).</p>
