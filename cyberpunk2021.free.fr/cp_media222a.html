Listen. You listen to me. You see that city over there? THAT'S where I'm supposed to be. Not down here with the dogs, and the garbage, and the fucking last month's newspapers blowing *back* and *forth*. I've had it with them, I've had it with you, I've had it with ALL THIS -<br>
<b>I WANT ROOM SERVICE!!!</b> I want the club sandwich, I want the cold Mexican beer,<br>
I want a $10,000-a-night hooker. I want my shirts laundered... like they do...<br>
at the Imperial Hotel... in Tokyo.</p>

<p><span class="r">Overview:</span> Johnny Mnemonic has always been a guilty pleasure of mine. Yes, this movie has problems, not the least of which is having a name that I can never remember how to spell, but overall, this movie is just pure cyberpunk fun! Johnny Mnemonic has a terrific mix of "punk" and "cyber" although it definitely strays to the "punk" side of things. He we have corporate domination, punk rebellion, modified humans (and dolphins!), dystopian societies and all the rest, all wrapped up in some wonderfully inspired William Gibson visuals.<br><br>
Johnny (played by <i>cyberpunk zen master</i>, Keanu Reeves) is a data courier who deals in somewhat shady and dangerous clients in need of data getting discretely transferred to another location. He has gotten a large chunk of his long term memory removed in order to have enough space to put a massive hard drive inside his head. Unfortuantely, his space isn't large enough for his newest high paying customer, but he still takes the assignment even though there's danger of data seepege into the brain. During the "transfer", all hell breaks loose, with guns and bullets flying everywhere. Johnny is forced to flee, and eventually hooks up with a damaged bodygaurd played by Dina Meyer. Together they attempt to deliver the data from China to New Jersey, but unfortunately, SERIOUS complications arise when they find out what Johnny is actually holding in his head. Ice Tea and Takeshi Kitano also have notable roles in this flick.</p>

<p><span class="r">The Bottom Line:</span> Johnny Mnemonic, while mostly a scifi thriller, has some terrific lines. For anyone who's seen this, you will remember the "I want room service" scene. I still love that! While I can't argue that this is a great movie, I do really enjoy it. Still, it clearly could have been better. But at least this is contrasted with a few really fun scenes.</p></div>
