<h2>GENERAL EQUIPEMENT</h2>
<p>Many of the items in this section are battery operated. Any device that uses batteries comes with them. As a rule, ignore battery life, assume characters are smart enough to recharge or replace their batteries between adventures, and that the batteries last as long as needed during adventures. If battery life is important in your game, roll 1D20 every time a battery-operated item is used. On a result of 1, the battery charge runs out and the item is useless. New batteries cost 10 eb.</p>

</table><br>
<h2>Descriptions</h2><p><b>Battery flare :</b> a battery powered bright candle, the charge only lasts for one hour but illuminates are area more than 15m in radius.</p><p><b>Battery flood :</b> practically a handheld spotlight, this item projects a bright beam 30m long and 15m across at its end.</p><p><b>Binoculars :</b> binoculars are useful for watching opponents, wild game, and sporting events from a long distance. Electro-optical binoculars function the same as standard binoculars in normal light. In darkness, however, users looking through them see in infrared.</p><p><b>Datafilm :</b> or datasuit, as it is also called. This incredibly thin suit is meant to be worn under powered armor, and transmits the wearer's commands to the landmate (ACPA). Datafilm has an SP of 4. It protects against acids, alkali's and other chemicals, lets sweat escape while repelling water and cushions shock. It's made of the same materials used to coat cyborg and landmate musculature. Datafilms come in a variety of colors and pattern and are made by several different companies. Due to the tight fit and variations in height, weight and structure each datafilm is custom made for the specific wearer. Cost varies from 500 eb to 2000 eb depending on manufacturer and design.</p><p><b>Digital audio recorder :</b> these tiny recorders (about the size of a deck of playing cards) can record up to eight hours of audio and can be connected to a computer to download the digital recording. Digital audio recorders don't have extremely sensitive microphones; they only pick up sounds within 3 meters.</p><p><b>Digital camera :</b> a digital camera uses no film; instead, its pictures are simply downloaded to a computer as image files. No film developing is necessary. The resolution is 30 mega-pixel.</p><p><b>Flash goggles :</b> these eye coverings provide total protection against blinding light. They work for one hour per charge.</p><p><b>Flashlight :</b> flashlights come in a wide variety of sizes and quality levels. Those covered here are professional, heavy-duty models, rugged enough to withstand the rigors of modern adventuring. Flashlights negate penalties for darkness within their illuminated areas. This heavy metal flashlight projects a beam 10m long and 3m across at its end.</p><p><b>Flashlight (penlight) :</b> flashlights come in a wide variety of sizes and quality levels. Those covered here are professional, heavy-duty models, rugged enough to withstand the rigors of modern adventuring. Flashlights negate penalties for darkness within their illuminated areas. This small flashlight can be carried on a key ring. It projects a beam of light 3m long and 1.5m wide at its end.</p><p><b>Glasscutter, circular :</b> this special device allows a person to cut through glass panes without cracking or shattering them in the process. It fits onto the glass with a suction cup and has a rotating arm that cuts a hole from 8 to 30 cm in diameter. Once the hole is cut, the suction cup is tugged, pulling out the circle of glass. The user makes a Picklock check (Difficulty 15 to 30 according to the thickness of the glass) to create a hole without shattering the glass. If the check fails, the glass shatters with a loud crash.</p><p><b>HV Field Pack :</b> the HV Field Pack must be purchased for a specific high quality rifle and can only be used for that specific rifle. That weapon can now use High Velocity rounds with lessened risk of damage. It cannot explode now. Single Shots don't overheat and bursts only melt the mechanism 10% of the time (the percentage does not increase).</p><p><b>Illuminator :</b> an illuminator is a small flashlight that mounts to a firearm, freeing up one of the user's hands. It functions as a standard flashlight.</p><p><b>Jaws of life :</b> this rescue tool is used by firefighters and aid personnel to try open the mangled doors of auto accidents. It requires a hydraulic compressor to work, but it is considered to have a BODY of 14 to open doors, bust through gates, and the like.</p><p><b>Laser sight :</b> this small laser mounts on a firearm, and projects a tiny red dot on the weapon's target. A laser sight grants a +1 accuracy bonus against targets no farther than 50m away. However, a laser sight can't be used outdoors during the daytime.</p><p><b>Metal detector :</b> this handheld device provides a +10 equipment bonus on all Awareness/Notice checks involving metal objects. The battery lasts one hour per charge.</p><p><b>Night vision goggles :</b> night vision goggles use passive light gathering to improve vision in near-dark conditions. They grant the user the ability to see in darkness, also called darkvision ; but because of the restricted field of view and lack of depth perception these goggles provide, they impose a -3 penalty on all Awareness/Notice checks made by someone wearing them. Night vision goggles must have at least a little light to operate. A cloudy night provides sufficient ambient light, but a pitch-black cave or a sealed room doesn't. For situations of total darkness, the goggles come with an infrared illuminator that, when switched on, operates like a flashlight whose light is visible only to the wearer (or anyone else wearing night vision goggles).</p><p><b>Portable stove :</b> this small stove works on CHOO², and can easily be broken down and carried for backpacking. The battery lasts for one hour per charge.</p><p><b>Purifying filter :</b> this removes all impurities from water to make it drinkable. This includes sifting water from sludge or even from mud. The Filter can create 200L of drinkable water before being saturated.</p><p><b>Ram, portable :</b> this modern ram is the perfect tool for battering down doors. Not only does it give you a +2 circumstance bonus on your BODY check to break open a door, but also it allows a second person to help you without having to make an aid another check, adding +2 bonus to your check.</p><p><b>Scope (electro-optical) :</b> an electro-optical scope functions the same as a standard scope in normal light. In darkness, however, the user sees through it as if he or she had the darkvision ability granted by night vision goggles.</p><p><b>Therm-optic Coat :</b> a coat that looks like a raincoat but when activated will cover the user in thermoptic camouflage. Unlike other thermoptics when this coat becomes wet, the thermoptics will not function. It is placed here and not under armor because it offers no protection. Like all therm-optics, the character gains a +6 bonus on Stealth checks if moving, or a +12 bonus when not moving (even though opponents can't see you, they might be able to figure out where you are from other visual clues plus therm-optics are not perfect). This bonus is cut in half if the character attacks another in melee or ranged. Water interference has a 40% chance of shorting out the coat for 2D6 rounds. Its total built in power source lasts for 5 minutes before draining.</p><p><b>Trail rations (12) :</b> trail rations come in a number of commercial options. They all provide the necessary energy and nutrition for survival. A case is 12 meals.</p><p><b>Walkie-talkie :</b> this high-end civilian model allows a character to program in twenty different frequencies from thousands of choices ; making it likely that the character can find a frequency that not being used by anyone else within range. The device can be used with or without a voice-activated headset (included). It has a range of 20 km.</p>
<br>
<h2>Restriction</h2>
<p>Some objects require licenses to own or operate, or are restricted in use to qualifying organizations or individuals. In such cases, a character must purchase a license or pay a fee to legally own the object. A license or fee is a separate item, purchased in addition to (and usually before) the object to which it applies. The four levels of restriction are as follows.</p><p><b>Licensed : </b>the owner must obtain a license to own or operate the object legally. Generally, the license is not expensive, and obtaining it has few if any additional legal requirements.</p><p><b>Restricted : </b>only specially qualified individuals or organizations are technically allowed to own the object. However, the real obstacles to ownership are time and money; anyone with sufficient patience and cash can eventually acquire the necessary license.</p><p><b>Military : </b>the object is sold primarily to legitimate police and military organizations. A military rating is essentially the same as restricted (see above), except that manufacturers and dealers are generally under tight government scrutiny and are therefore especially wary of selling to private individuals.</p><p><b>Illegal : </b>the object is illegal in all but specific, highly regulated circumstances.</p>
<h3>Purchasing a license</h3>
<p>The license is issued to the character after the number of days indicated. To speed the process, the hero can make a Resources check against a DC (Lic 15, Rest 20, Mil 25, Ill 30). Success results in the license being issued in 1D6 hours. (During the process of character creation, a character just needs to purchase the license or pay the fee; the time required takes place before game play begins).<br>
As a general rule, a character must obtain the appropriate license before buying a restricted object. Legitimate dealers will not sell restricted objects to a character who does not have the necessary license. However, a character may be able to turn to the black market (see below) to obtain restricted objects without a license.</p>

</table>
<h3>Black Market</h3>
<p>Sometimes a character wants to obtain an object without going through the hassle of getting a license first. Almost anything is available on the black market. Streetwise checks can be used to locate a black market merchant. The DC is based on the location in question : 15 to find a black market merchant in a big city, or 20, 25, or higher in small towns and rural areas. Objects purchased on the black market are more expensive than those purchased legally. Add the black market purchase modifier from previous table to the object's purchase price.<br>
Obtaining an object on the black market takes a number of days according to the Time Required column. The process can be hurried, but each day cut out of the process (to a minimum of one day) increases the purchase price by an additional 20%.</p></div><br>
