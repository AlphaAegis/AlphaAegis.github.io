<h3>ARTILLERY</h3>
<p>Damage : basic damage done by standard projectile.<br>
Blast area : explosion - affected area for standard projectile.<br>
Ammo supply : magazine capacity.<br>
Rate of fire : how many projectiles can the system fire per 3 second round.<br>
Reliability : same as in CP2020.<br>
Range : effective range in meters, see notes below.<br>
Deploy time : how long it takes to turn the system from transport position to firing position.</p>

<h3 class="b">Notes</h3>
<p>Availability and concealability of the given weapons isn't listed for obvious reasons - they are far too big to be hidden on any person, and available only to powerful organisations, like governments and the mightiest, most war-like corporations.<br>
Rate of fire can vary dramatically from the Maximum Metal values - that's because I'm using real-life equivalents. Whoever wrote the Maximum Metal section on automatic weapons, had little idea on how fast do these things shoot !<br>
Range is given as in real gun systems - maximum effective range. For direct fire, it's the longest range where you can actually hit something and harm it (equivalent of CP2020 &quot;long&quot; range). For indirect fire, it's just how much distance you can push between the gun and the hit point (CP2020 &quot;extreme&quot; distance).</p>

<h3 class="b">Option</h3>
<p>RAP - Rocket-assisted projectiles. This is artillery ammunition - shells launched from a normal cannon (usually a howitzer), but equipped with rocket motor to boost the range. RAP ammo has +25% range, takes 30% more space, and it costs +50% of the given basic price (say, you take a chemical - tear gas - RAP shell for a 150 mm howitzer. A 150 mm round costs 1000 eb, chemical gas doubles it to 2000 eb, and RAP motor is +50% of the basic price - 2500 eb total. It takes 1,3 space and has a range of 21.25 km).</p></div>

		<tr><td class="d">Somewhere, on an island in the pacific off the coast of Japan, Arasaka has a top secret research facility, fully sponsored by the United States government. On this island is being manufactured the most powerful gun ever built, a railgun chambered in 60 mm gauss. Supposedly the US military has plans of putting this nightmare on an aircraft carrier, thats the only vessel big enough to mount and fire this weapon. Initial tests project that the weapon has a range of almost 2500 km. In other words, you could shell Fort Worth Texas from Manhattan New York.<br>The weapon project is making the rest of the world very nervous, especially due to the rumor circulating that one of the stipulations for building the weapon was that Japan would receive the first completed weapon, making China and Korea extremely nervous. Not only that, but with a carrier mounted weapon of this size, all you would need would be to park somewhere in international waters of Europe and you could pretty much attack any country, without setting off early warning systems. Load the weapon with mass destruction able ammunition, and you have an exceedingly scary scenario. It is also conceivable that the weapon could be used to knock out orbital satellites and stations. Many people are begining to fear another Colorado Springs incident, especially in light of the current conflict in Africa. In theory when complete, the weapon will use satelite targeting, for pinpoint accuracy. The weapon has yet to be fired, in fact no hard evidence exists that the weapon even exists except this grainy image and rumors.</td></tr>

		<tr><td class="d">* 980 kg warhead of either conventional or mass-destruction type, damage and blast area depend on warhead.<br>This is an (2020-upgraded) unlicensed copy of the original SCUD / SS-1 Soviet ballistic missile. One of the favourite toys of third-world dictators, Scud can hit a 50m circle from about 550 kilometers. Since it carries a one-ton explosive warhead, or nuclear, biological or chemical warhead (chemical are most likely - they're cheap, and easy to produce), greater precision isn't required. The Scud can't track any targets - it's inertial guidance system leads it to hit a pre-destined place on Earth, no matter what will be there. Please note that any modern counter-missile system will most probably blast the Scud off the sky before it could reach it's target.<br>Each missile costs 20000 eb (plus whatever warhead you want for it), and takes 50 spaces (launcher takes 60 spaces). Here, it's mounted on a knock-off of the original Russian MAZ-543 vehicle, but it is not unknown to have Scuds installed on seagoing vessels (although this tends to hamper their accuracy). They are sold exhaustively in Asia and Africa.</td></tr>

		<tr><td class="d">If you really need a big-ass gun, buy from Skoda. Even if howitzers that big are an obsolete idea, Skoda makes them for the willing customers, using all the technological wonders of 21st century. The vehicle - a specially -projected tracked carrier from Tatra company - can ride wherever is enough space to fit it, and the gun is completely computer-controlled. Stabilisers do deploy on a command, fixing the behemoth to the ground at best possible angle, and the carriage turns and elevates the barrel into ordered position. A second, accompanying ammo vehicle, based on the very same design, loads Dora using it's own crane, and the howitzer is then aimed and fired - all that with the crew staying comfortably within vehicles.</td></tr>

		<tr><td class="d">South African creation, and it's really frightening. This monstrosity has been created along similar lines as Dora - modern technology for an obsolete application. M-6 are used as coastal defence guns - their recoil makes them useless in anything but fixed defence positions, and usually the ports are the only installations that may need such defences. In fact, modern defense systems are usually anti-surface missile batteries, and M-6 has an advantage over these : there's a number of ways to fool or destroy missile in flight, but no way to stop a cannon round once it's fired. A logical conclusion, such gun must be stopped from firing - which can be easily acheived in a number of ways.</td></tr>

Guided by active radar and optical (in the final phase) homing systems, the missile will take erratic evasive maneuvers (planned by her fuzzy-logic computer) to protect the missile against enemy Phalanx missile defense systems. And it can ruin the day of any ship, including the biggest supercarriers. This is Russia most devastating weapon, and it sells them to the EDF, which makes the United States very nervous.</td></tr>
