		<h4>Review</h4>
		<p>This supplement analyses a Night City club founded by veterans of the Central American War. The NPCs and the club are quite detailed, but we would have liked more details on the &quot;community&quot; aspect of the veterans. Presented as an interview, the first 25 pages are dedicated to the club, and the next 80 are a compilation of scenarios, each one more basic than the other, whose only common point is that the NPCs are recruited from the above-mentioned club. This supplement is nice, but instead of 8 mediocre scenarios, we would have preferred a deepening of the club and of the parallel activities of which it is the hub, the mutual aid network of the &quot;south-am vets&quot;.</p>
