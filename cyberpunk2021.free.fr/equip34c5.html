<h2>GRENADES</h2><p>Cyberpunk 2020's world grenades range from very dangerous to harmless. With few exceptions, they are obviously illegal. You will therefore have to contact your preferred fixer to find some. The prices indicated are those charged by legal arms dealers. The prices on the black market are obviously higher.<br>Grenades are multiple models : the most classic are to be thrown by hand. The more advanced models are attached to the barrel of a weapon and are propelled by the impact of the bullet. The ultimate is the self-propelled grenade, which looks like a large cartridge, and should be used with a grenade launcher.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>HAND GRENADES</h3>
<p><a name="e5">Anti-tank grenade</a> <b>$50</b><br>5D10 AP to the target (damage is not halved), then 3D6 damage points by fragmentation within a radius of five meters. This grenade can be found in the armies of the Eastern Block and in Third World countries. The bands (which prevent the grenade from swirling) and its high weight (1.5 kg) halve the range of this grenade.</p>
<p><a name="e12">Chemical grenade</a> <b>$20 to $50</b><br>10 meters radius of effect for these grenades dispersing any gas or smoke. They can release their gas at once, or gradually, for a more lasting effect. Tear gas, hilarious and soporific are the most common. Neurotoxins are also found in military stocks.</p>
<p><a name="e4">Dispersion grenade</a> <b>$70 (<i>Chromebook 2</i>)</b><br>Grenade that fills a 5 meters area with smoke and anti-IR and anti-thermal detectors particles. The cloud lasts five rounds.</p>
<p><a name="e14">EMP grenade</a> <b>$300 (<i>Chromebook 1</i>)</b><br>In a 10 meters zone, the fusion of this grenade causes short circuits in electronic components. Internal cybernetic equipment stops working for 1D6 minutes and cyberlimbs for 2D6 minutes. Memory chips are erased and electronic systems, depending on their complexity, fail permanently or for a few minutes. A non-cybernetized person loses his sense of orientation for about ten seconds (stun save at -1).</p>
<p><a name="e2">FEN Dz 25 Det Card</a> <b>$120 (<i>Chromebook 1</i>)</b><br>This grenade is the size of a credit card. It explodes 20 seconds after breaking it in half. Damage : 1D6+2 within a radius of two meters.</p>
<p><a name="e3">Fen Dz 22</a> <b>$65 (<i>Chromebook 1</i>)</b><br>It's a grenade filled with an explosive liquid. Its general shape is that of a saucer (12 cm in diameter by 15 mm thick). It's thrown like a Frisbee (+2 in athletics). The damage is 2D6+3 in a diameter of 15 meters. It also has a rubbery band on its circumference to bounce off objects.</p>
<p><a name="e140">Flare grenade</a> <b>$15</b><br>The lighting covers a radius of 20 meters and turned on by an internal gyroscope. Some older versions use a timer that must be set before shooting.</p>
<p><a name="e8">Flashbang</a> <b>$40</b><br>Damage : 4D10 in concussion within a radius of 5 meters (rigid armors protect a quarter of their value). The syncope lasts 1D10 minutes in total. The glass breaks in the 10 meters around. Everyone watching the simultaneous flash should succeed a very difficult COOL + Resist Torture/Drugs test to not be taken with convulsions or paralysis for 1D6 minutes.</p>
<p><a name="e6">High explosive defensive grenade</a> <b>$30</b><br>It inflicts 7D6 damage points within a radius of 5 meters, and 3D6 within a radius of 10 meters. Some of these grenades have a removable shell, which allows them to be quickly transformed into offensive grenades.</p>
<p><a name="e9">Incendiary phosphorus grenade</a> <b>$30</b><br>It inflicts 4D6 points of fire damage for three turns within a radius of 5 meters. Armor drops two points per round.</p>
<p><a name="e11">Militech PDU-3 Multi-purpose Perimeter Defense Unit</a> <b>$150 (<i>Chromebook 2</i>)</b><br>It's a 7.5 x 7.5 x 2 cm box, which contains an adjustable delay system, an IR detector, a magnetic surface and a sticky surface. Damage by projection of ceramic debris : 2D6+5 within a radius of 2.5 meters. Also available as a gas model. Used to protect a perimeter or cover an escape.</p>
<p><a name="e16">Mini-grenade Gpz-78</a> <b>$40</b><br>Small grenade of 4 cm diameter. It causes 1D6+2 damage points within a three meters radius.</p>
<p><a name="e15">Ninja smoke grenade</a> <b>$25 for 5</b><br>Contain smoke powder that explodes on impact. Essentially diverts attention for a few seconds.</p>
<p><a name="e10">Offensive grenade</a> <b>$30</b><br>All persons within 3 meters of the explosion suffer 4D6 damage points, 2D6 if they are between 4 and 6 meters. The damage is semi-real, and the armor only protects a quarter of its value.</p>
<p><a name="e13">Paint grenade</a> <b>$20 (<i>Chromebook 2</i>)</b><br>Spray paint over a three meters area. A nearby target can be blinded for 1D6/3 minutes.</p>
<p><a name="e139">Smoke grenade</a> <b>$35</b><br>This grenade releases a cloud of smoke covering a radius of 5 meters for 12 turns.</p>
<p><a name="e1">Stink bomb</a> <b>$20 (<i>Chromebook 2</i>)</b><br>All those present must attempt a very difficult COOL or BODY roll to avoid leaving the area. The cloud covers an area of 5 x 5 meters.</p>
<p><a name="e7">Stun grenade</a> <b>$30</b><br>Anyone within a four meters radius must make a -5 stun save to avoid fainting. Duration : 1D6 minutes. 2D6-1 damage points, half of which are semi-real.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>DCR PISTOL GRENADES</h3><p>These grenades have a range of 50 meters for a heavy pistol, and 20 meters for a medium pistol (choose it well in this case!), and are fixed at the end of the barrel, thanks to an adapter ($50). Their effects are the same as 25 mm grenades.<br><h4>25 MM MINI GRENADES FOR DCR GRENADE LAUNCHERS</h4></p>
<p><a name="e18">Darts</a> <b>$25</b><br>This grenade exploded three meters from the shooter. Any target in the line of the shot and within 25 meters of the explosion suffers damage from 1D6+1 darts, each inflicting 1D6 AP. Maximum range : 150 meters.</p>
<p><a name="e17">Flashbang</a> <b>$15</b><br>Within a radius of 5 meters, stun save reduced by -2. -4 in REF and Perception for 5 turns if you miss a very difficult roll COOL + Resist Torture/Drugs test.</p>
<p><a name="e19">Fragmentation defensive</a> <b>$25</b><br>5D6 damage points within a radius of five meters. Shrapnels up to 20 meters.</p>
<p><a name="e22">HEP (High Explosive Piercing)</a> <b>$30</b><br>5D6 damage points to the target. The armor is ineffective and loses two levels, and the damage is semi-real.</p>
<p><a name="e23">Incendiary</a> <b>$30</b><br>4D6 damage points in the first round, 2D6 in the second, 1D6 in the third. Flammable objects ignite within a one meter radius. The armor loses two levels for each hit received.</p>
<p><a name="e20">Offensive</a> <b>$20</b><br>4D6 concussion damage points within a five meters radius. Half the damage is real.</p>
<p><a name="e24">Slasher</a> <b>$130</b><br>Launchs two projectiles connected by a monofilament. Accuracy -2, damage 4D6, armor divided by 3. Width 2 meters. The wire has a 50% chance of wrapping around the target.</p>
<p><a name="e21">Smoke/tear gas</a> <b>$20-30</b><br>Variable effects within a radius of 3 to 5 meters depending on the product used.</p>
<p><a name="e25">Stun</a> <b>$15</b><br>3D6 concussion damage points within a radius of four meters (armor protects a third of its value).</p>
<p><a name="e26">Stundart</a> <b>$15</b><br>Acts like a taser. Stun save at -4 to stay conscious. Penetrate up to 12 points of soft armor.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>DCR RIFLE GRENADES</h3><p>Most assault rifles can fire these grenades (this is a standard used by NATO), but civilian or non-equipped rifles can accept them with an adapter (about 50 eb). Standard range : 100 meters. Grenades equipped with a propeller can be found, which doubles the range, but makes the grenade less accurate. The shooting is done in a arc, generally by pressing the stick of the weapon on the ground, like a mortar, or in a tense shot in the case of anti-tanks in particular. Their effects are identical to the corresponding hand grenades. The shooting is done using the Heavy Weapons skill, with an accuracy of -3.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>40 MM GRENADES</h3><p>These grenades require a grenade launcher. Most will not arm themselves within 10 meters, in order to protect the shooter. They are also available in a &quot;high speed&quot; version, with a longer body and a better range, mainly used by automatic launchers. Shooting one of these grenades with a normal launcher is normally impossible, as the cartridge is longer, and will cause its destruction and serious damage to the shooter.</p>
<p><a name="e28">Anti-tank</a> <b>$50</b><br>Causes 4D10 AP and 4D6 points of damage to any other target within a one meter radius.</p>
<p><a name="e29">Chemical</a> <b>$30</b><br>This grenade emits any type of gas over a radius of ten meters.</p>
<p><a name="e33">Darts</a> <b>$50</b><br>This grenade exploded three meters from the shooter. Any target in the line of the shot and within 25 meters of the explosion suffers damage from 1D6/2 darts, each inflicting 2D6 AP.</p>
<p><a name="e30">Flare</a> <b>$25</b><br>It illuminates over a radius of twenty meters around the point of impact. On a target, it inflicts 1D6 damage points for 6 turns. It will not explode within ten meters of where it was fired.</p>
<p><a name="e32">Flashbang</a> <b>$40</b><br>Any target within a radius of 7 meters must do a successfully stun save at -2 or fall unconscious. In addition, people who are still conscious must pass a roll of COOL + Resist Torture/Drugs in order to not be blinded by the flash (-4 in REF and Perception for 5 rounds).</p>
<p><a name="e34">Grapnel</a> <b>$60</b><br>The Bregna Enterprises Pistol Grenade Grapnel is based on the same premise as Militech's 25mm Pistol-Grenade, this small 25x100 mm, pistol launched grappling hook (seen at right mounted on a Monnikkan Arms AE-1 Subgun), uses the same bullet-trap muzzle adaptor (200 eb installed) as the other pistol-grenades. It has the same weapon caliber and range limitations as the other pistol-grenades. If the grapnel is fired at an individual treat the round as AP (i.e., opponent's SP halved), but the grapnel will do the full damage (as the appropriate calibre round), and the target will also take the same amount of damage again if the round is removed by anyone but trained medical personnel (a Difficult Medtech or Very Difficult First Aid roll).</p>
<p><a name="e35">HEP (High Explosive Piercing)</a> <b>$40</b><br>The target suffers 7D6 points of damage, half of which is semi-real. The armor SP is reduced by 5 points, and does not protect the target.</p>
<p><a name="e36">High Explosive</a> <b>$50</b><br>Causes 7D6 points of damage within a radius of 5 meters (shrapnels at 40 meters). Do not arm if encounter an obstacle within ten meters of the point of shooting.</p>
<p><a name="e27">Impact</a> <b>$40</b><br>This is a gel bag, which have a maximum range of 50 meters for any launcher model. It inflicts 2D6 damage points. The target must also pass a stun save at -5 (+1 per 10 SP), and a difficulty roll of 20 in REF to keep its balance (the difficulty drops by 1 for each 100 kilos of the target).</p>
<p><a name="e31">Net</a> <b>$60</b><br>A two meters net is projected towards the target. Accuracy : -5, range : 25 meters. The target can endure 1D6 points of damage due to the weights on the net. It has a 50% chance of wrapping itself around the target. A BODY + Strength Feat roll of difficulty 25 is required to escape. It takes two turns to get out with a cutting tool.</p>
<p><a name="e37">Slasher</a> <b>$50</b><br>Same as the cartridge for shotgun. Width : 3 meters, damage : 5D6, accuracy : -2.</p>
<p><a name="e38">White Phosphorus</a> <b>$40</b><br>This grenade releases a cloud of incandescent phosphorus within a radius of 10 meters. Anyone in the area suffers 4D6 damage for three turns.</p></div>
