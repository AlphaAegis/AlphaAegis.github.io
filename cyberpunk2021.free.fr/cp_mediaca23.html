<p><span class="r">Overview:</span> In pursuit of me desire to see all cyberpunk-like films out, I was seduced into getting this flick. Terminatrix is basically the original terminator movie remade with in naked Japanese chicks. In Terminatrix's vision of the future, an evil artificial intelligence has taken over the human race, and sex is fully regulated to stop overpopulation. But one woman, seeing the injustice in this system, rebels (This is the John Conner stand-in) and starts the resistance by convincing everyone to have massive orgies of their own free choosing. To stop this, the AI sends a hot Japanese cyborg chick - the Terminatrix, played by Japanese Exploitation Queen Kei Mizutani, back in time to have find the father of the chick who leads the orgy resistance. The Terminatrix has the ability to make people impotent by fucking them and breaking their dicks off (this also seems to kill them as well). To find our future heroine's father, the Terminatrix doesn't know his middle name, so, um, she goes through the phone book in order to kill the male Sarah Conner stand-in. In an attempt to stop this foul plot, the resistance is able to send a single hot naked human chick (Reece's replacement - I must say, she looks a lot better than Reece!) is sent back to stop her and to save the father (Sarah Conner substitute). Our Reece substitute can tell who Terminatrix is by checking out her ass, so she is forced to go around lifting up all the women's skirts!<br><br>
Yes, this plot is as cheesy as they come, but let me be clear about this - Terminatrix is a frickin RIOT!!! Why, you ask? On an extremely twisted level, Terminatrix so closely follows the Terminator story that you're continually busting out in laughter. On top of this, both the writing and production values are far above what you'd normally expect from a movie such as this. Literally, if you're as familiar with that movie as I am, and have a soft spot for over-the-top cheesefests, you will LOVE this movie.<br><br>
The terminatrix's cyborg vision lines are a riot. When having sex (they don't get explicit here, just frontal nudity) with her victems, the Terminatrix's "terminator screen" messages show things like, <i>"Not cuming fast enough"</i> or <i>"Whip him."</i>. When the Reece chick finds the future father, she says, <i>"The future of humanity depends on your penis!"</i> At least he has the good sense to shut the door on her. Also, if Terminatrix's future prognostication is any guide, the future is tailor-made for male chauvinists. In this "dystopia", a computer calls you to have sex with random chicks - but here's the bad part - you have to lay down while they to all the work! Hmm...come to think of it, I can probably imagine worse computer-dominated future scenarios than the one that prompted the revolution.</p>
<p><span class="r"> Funniest scene </span> Hands down, the bathroom cyborg self-repair scene is a riot! You know the one I'm talking about - where Arnold has to fix up his face and stuff? In this version, the Terminatrix has been shot six times in her primary weapon (her vagina), and has to repair it. While rolling her eyes, she forces six bullets to come out of her vagina (they don't show this other than by the dropping of bullets), then she recharges herself by putting electricity through her nipples. To make final repairs, she fixes herself down below by sitting on a mechanical dildo! In watching this, all you can say is "My God, what a bizarre flick!"</p>
<p><span class="r"> The Bottom Line </span> Again, I'm rather shocked that Terminatrix has relatively decent production values. The acting isn't bad either, so much so that it's like they made a serious attempt at this! I didn't attempt the dubbing track (I almost never do), but I'm guessing it's something to stear away from. All in all, Terminatrix is a very fun entry into the cyberpunk (facade) soft-core porn market. And while this clearly isn't cyberpunk, it is definitely a cyberpunk parody (of the Terminator). Fair warning - this movie will make you laugh out loud - it will not get you in the "mood."<br><br>
And my apologies for the lack of screencaps. I honestly tried to take screencaps but it was a waste of time, as all the cool scenes had nudity in them.</p></div>
