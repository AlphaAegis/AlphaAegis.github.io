<p><span class="r">Overview:</span> Some movies are just absolute absurd fun ? so fun that you end up watching it endlessly. The Fifth Element is that way for me, and is a movie I've seen around 20 times or so. The tone of the movie is too light-hearted to be considered a real cyberpunk movie, but like Tank Girl, we can consider this a cyberpunk comedy. The characters are all a hoot, and the movie never takes itself seriously ? in fact it's almost always over the top. Many of the cyberpunk themes still exist in Fifth Element, although, again, they are enacted in a light-hearted way. It's the visuals that really bring Fifth Element into the cyberpunk subgenre.</p>
<p><img src="http://cyberpunk2021.free.fr/images/review/The_Fifth_Element_02.jpg"></p>
<p><span class="r">The Story:</span> 217 years into the future, ultimate evil is again coming to destroy the earth. Ultimate evil takes the form of an absolutely massive malevolent ball of blackness that is on a course to destroy earth. Every attack the Federated Territories try only makes it larger. It turns out that a group of priests has been keeping the ancient technology necessary to destroy ultimate evil ? four stones representing the 4 elements, which surround a fifth element. In this case, the fifth element is s beautiful girl (Milla Jovovich), reconstructed from the remains of a small DNA sample.</p>
<p class="q"><img src="http://cyberpunk2021.free.fr/images/review/The_Fifth_Element_03.jpg"><br>
"Leeloo Dallas, Multi Pass"</p>
<p>Korben Dallas (Bruce Willis) is a down and out highly decorated former military commando, now turned failing cabbie, who has a beautiful girl named Leeloo (Jovovich) fall into her cab ? literally! The authorities are after her, as it turns out she has escaped those who recreated her. She can't speak English yet she figures a way to ask for help. After she asks, Korben Dallas takes her to the priest, Father Vito Cornelius, who recognizes her as the Fifth Element, and promptly kicks Korben out.</p>
<p><img src="http://cyberpunk2021.free.fr/images/review/The_Fifth_Element_04.jpg"></p>
<p>From there, things get crazy. The military approaches Korben for a secret mission to retrieve the stones necessary to stop ultimate evil. The stones are hidden with a famous Diva who is performing at the famous floating hotel, Floston Paradise. At the same time, Zorg, an evil corporate CEO (Gary Oldman) has hired a group of Mangalores (evil, ugly aliens) to retrieve the stones. Simultaneously, Father Vito Cornelius and Leeloo also find a way get to Floston Paradise to retrieve the stones. Things get even weirder when the famous radio host, Ruby Rhod (Chris Tucker), an outrageous guy with a penis-head hairdo hosts the Floston Paradise experience with Korben as his guest!</p>
<p><img src="http://cyberpunk2021.free.fr/images/review/The_Fifth_Element_05.jpg"></p>
<p><span class="r">The Acting:</span> All the main characters in the Fifth Element are quirky and memorable. Bruce Willis really works as a former hero, now on his last leg. Jovovich is beautiful and otherworldly. Tucker is a riot! This movie really got him known (Rush Hour made him famous though). And Gary Oldman as Zorg is flat out awesome as a completely crazed power-hungry evil doer with a quirky sense of style and salesmanship. Truly, Besson did a great job in casting this.</p>
<p><img src="http://cyberpunk2021.free.fr/images/review/The_Fifth_Element_06.jpg"></p>
<p><span class="r">The Visuals:</span> The Fifth Element totally rocks in the cool futuristic visuals department. The colors include dark yellows with neon blues for the backgrounds, saturated blue scenes and orange clothes for the leads. But its the city-scapes, reminiscent of Lang's Metropolis that are especially memorable. They flat out nail a far out vision of the future. Additionally, we have airports with 30 foot tall trash heaps due to a garbage worker strike, fully automated, ultra-processed McDonalds, deaf rock stars</p>
<p><img src="http://cyberpunk2021.free.fr/images/review/The_Fifth_Element_07.jpg"></p>
<p><span class="r">The Editing:</span> The editing in the Fifth Element is just terrific. The splicing of the various story strands, as crazy as they are, flow wonderfully. In discussing the missing stones, the simultaneous, intermixed dialogue between Leeloo and Father Cornelius and Zorg with the Mangalores are just one terrific example of this; the Diva opera singling intermixed with Leeloo's fighting is another. With the amount of stuff going on here, this could have ended up a disaster. Sylvie Landra, who also edited Leon ? the Professional, deserves heaps of praise for this.</p>
<p><img src="http://cyberpunk2021.free.fr/images/review/The_Fifth_Element_08.jpg"></p>
<p><span class="r">The Fifth Element Cyberpunked Future:</span> Dropping the crazed fantasy aspects of the stones and ultimate evil, The Fifth Element gives us a pretty dire view of the future. Cities are built high to escape the constant layer of smog that coats the surface; corporations are all-powerful; governments are impotent; fashion statements have gone seriously awry; cockroaches are used as intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance systems - but at least we still get cheap Chinese food! Plus robots now do all our menial work!</p>
<p><img src="http://cyberpunk2021.free.fr/images/review/The_Fifth_Element_09.jpg"></p>
<p><span class="r">The Bottom Line:</span> No, the Fifth Element is not intended to be taken seriously. Still, this movie is just far more enjoyable than it has any right to be. The action and romance are fun, the characters are unforgettable, the story is entertaining, the music is great, and the visuals are marvelous! The Fifth Element has been in my regular heavy watching rotation since it came out. Give this a watch if you're looking for a witty futuristic cyberpunk action-comedy flick.</p></div>
