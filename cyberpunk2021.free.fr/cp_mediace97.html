<p><span class="r">Overview:</span> Bronx Executioner is yet another example of a movie where they spent more on the completely unrelated cover art than they did the entire production. Truly, looking at that, and in reading the cool description, you'd think this is might be a pretty decent low-budget cyberpunk flick. Here's the description:<br><br>
Android gangs battle humans and Robotic Replicants in the New York City of the near future. The sector sheriff must join forces with a gigantic, yet unpredictable Replicant in order to save the city...<br><br>
Now, for what you actually get:</p>
<ul>
<li>Absolutely NO replicant or robot visuals</li>
<li>NO dystopic New York. This was clearly filmed in the Italian equivalent of the outskirts of Los Angeles. The terrain is dry, and boring - no dystopic city here folks.</li>
<li>a truly horrid Master-student sheriff coming of age story, that in the end is completely pointless</li>
<li>Robots that supposedly have no emotion but still enjoy raping humans. I guess their parts work.</li>
<li>a low quality body builder who can't act to save his life who tells us he's a robot replicant (we have to believe him as NONE of the replicants look like anything but humans)
<li>Lots and lots and lots of low quality gun fights between biker looking dudes (but we're told half of them are robots). Road Warriors this isn't!</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="r">The Bottom Line:</span> The story pretty much sums this movie up: it's about a body builder replicant who falls in love with a human (even though he doesn't have the capability to fall in love) who gets raped by really mean replicants, so the body builder replicant asks the junior cop to help him get even with the meanie replicants. Sound stupid? Bingo! It's pretty bad. And unfortunately, it's not so bad that it's good. The gratuitous breast shots just can't save this turkey. It's just bad, K?</p></div>
