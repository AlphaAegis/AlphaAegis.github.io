<h1>Idoru</h1>
</center><br>
<div class="c">
<p>In <i>Idoru</i> Gibson concentrates on the themes of media and popularity in a post-cyberpunk setting. Idoru is set in the same universe as <i>Virtual Light</i>, and the main characters of both books are also very similar. But the world is better realised here than <i>Virtual Light</i>, feeling deeper and realer. This is not to say that it's entirely plausible - some technical aspects are suspect, such as the very restrained impact of nanotechnology, and aspects of the climax are opaque to everyone, including the author, I suspect. Conversely Gibson shows a deft sense of consumer level technology, with believable earclip translators, personalised computers and software-rich environments. The plotting is also somewhat improved on its predecessor. While <i>Virtual Light</i> was an enjoyable book, it consisted almost entirely of asides and diversions. <i>Idoru</i> is more directed, with the plot developing and twisting as it goes along.</p>
<p>Idoru is a Japanese word derived from the English &quot;idol&quot;. In the book the idoru appears as a completely artificial media celebrity. While there's the usual hacking, computer warfare, and skullduggery, the chief focus of Idoru is identity and fame : what does it mean to be famous, what does it mean to be real ? What is fantasy ? What is reality ? Does it matter ?</p>
<br>
<h3>Synopsis</h3>
<p>Early in the next century, Lo/Rez is more than just the hottest rock band in the world, it's a business. The enigmatic guru-like guitar hero Rez has announced that he will marry Rei Toei, the most popular musician in Japan. But she doesn't exist. She's an idoru, a massively-complex computer program designed to create and perform music in concerts. So Rez's obsession leads a teenage fan and a disgraced data-miner in a bizarre journey through rebuilt Tokyo, the machinations of Lo/Rez's corporation, the criminal underworld and an ethereal hacker kingdom.</p>
