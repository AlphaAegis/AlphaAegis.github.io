		<h4>Review</h4>
		<p>As TSR had once published one companion per character class, Talsorian is releasing a book on nomads. It is true that this type of character had been a little neglected before. Fortunately, it seems more of a complement to the already copious Home of the Brave, dealing mainly with nomadic tribes in the disaster-stricken America of the 21st century. Expanding on this somewhat fuzzy character class in CP2020, several alternative tribal nations and archetypes are provided for players willing to try out these kinds of characters.</p>
