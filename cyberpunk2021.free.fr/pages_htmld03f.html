<h2>VARIOUS TYPES OF AMMUNITION</h2>
<p>Here are the main types of powder ammo used inthe Cyberpunk 2020 world. These devices are based on a principle known since more than a century : propel a heavy projectile (made of lead, or more rarely of Uranium for heavy weapons, sometimes jacketed with a more rigid metal, like brass, copper or steel, and maybe a lubricating coating like teflon to reduce barrel friction) with the the expanding gases producedby a fast-burning propellant. The propellant itself is ignited by a percussion cap, at the rear of the cartridge.</p>

<p>1) Revolver cartridge. It has a rimmed base, which allows the bullet to be clamped in the cylinder, and it's straight. The case istraditionaly made of brass or plastic (more common in 2020)</p>
<p>2) Pistol cartridge, with a groove instead of a rim, allowing easier packing of the rounds in the magazine. The material isthe same as in a revolver cartridge. These ammo are also used in carbinesor older rifle design.</p>
<p>3) Assault rifle or hunting rifle cartridge, longer than a hand weapon or a carbine round and generally bottle-necked for largerpowder capacity and increased power. The material used for the case isidentical to the previous one.<br>
The projectile is more aerodynamic than a handgun's one,because it is meant to be fire at high velocity and longer range.</p>
<p>4) Hunting shot cartridge. There are several projectiles, spreading out to create a cone of fire. The case is generally made of plastic,and a cap prevent the content from falling. These cartridges are used in hunting rifles, riot guns (automatic shot rifles) and shotguns with a pump action. Those weapons have no rifling in their barrel.</p>
<p>5) Caseless cartridge. Here, the powder is the casing of the projectile. A varnishing protects it from moisture and moderate schocks. There is few matter left after the powder has exploded. The cross-section is generally square for a thighter packing in the magazine, but there are some exceptions.<br>
Caseless ammo can be used in handguns or rifle as well.The advantage of the caseless ammo lies essentially in its small weigthand optimized volume. It is more sensitive than a cased ammo to moisture and shocks, and can't be easily adapted for use in a revolver (the chambers of the cylinder are bored from side to side and it's the case that holdsthe round in place and close the back).</p>
