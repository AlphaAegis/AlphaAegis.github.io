		<h4>Review</h4>
		<p>This scenario deals with a relatively serious subject, giving it a tragic and dark aspect. Here, no spectacular blackops : it is rather about domestic violence and pedophilia. The authors wanted to demonstrate that one can also play on serious themes. The scenario is very interesting, and the oppressive atmosphere will certainly not suit all audiences. Some vampires are also present, but staged in an interesting way, which doesn't spoil anything. Alternate Reality supplements such as Night's Edge in particular are recommended to complete this scenario.</p>
