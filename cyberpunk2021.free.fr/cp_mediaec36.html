<p><span class="r">Overview:</span> While Alien 1 and 2 were both stellar movies, the later two sequels definite suffer in comparison. Still, Alien Resurrection provides a significantly different Ripley than is encountered in the first three movies. Ripley is a clone, and an altered one at that. In fact she's a merging of both the alien and human. With a significantly different approach to visuals and storytelling, Alien Resurrection may not equal the quality of the first two, but certainly can be considered original, which is sometimes a feat in itself for a sequel. The cyberpunk elements, while present, are still sedated, similar to the first Alien (I don't really consider Alien 2 or 3 to have enough to consider them cyberpunk).</p>
<p><img src="http://cyberpunk2021.free.fr/images/review/Alien_4_02.jpg"></p>
<p><span class="r">The Story:</span> Two hundred years after her death, Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) has been cloned for the purpose of giving birth to the Alien Queen inside of her at the end of Alien 3. It's not the corporation this time, instead it's the good ol' government. While it's never really fully explained how the melding of the two came about, you basically have to "roll" with it if you want to enjoy the movie. In any event, Ripley somehow survives the birth of the Alien, and is kept alive for "study" purposes.</p>
<p><img src="http://cyberpunk2021.free.fr/images/review/Alien_4_03.jpg"></p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Alien Queen that Ripley births requires hosts for her eggs. Enter a group of mercenaries led by Elgyn (Michael Wincott). His group also includes Winona Ryder, Dominique Pinon, Ron Perlman, Gary Dourdan, and Kim Flowers. The mercenaries have captured a ship full of people in suspended animation, and have brought the victims to the military research ship for money and other goodies (including a few days sleep in a regular bed). Things go bad when fanatatical crazed head scientist, Dr. Jonathan Gediman (Brad Dourif) makes the mistake of leaving three of the Alien births in the same cage. Two of the aliens kill the third, who's acidic innards then create a hole in the floor, thus forming a jail break. From there, its on ? aliens are in control and have a field day in eating up the poor humans who can't escape on time. But unfortunately for the Queen, her DNA has been melded with Ripley's and her second generation offspring has turned out differently than intended.</p>
<p><img src="http://cyberpunk2021.free.fr/images/review/Alien_4_04.jpg"></p>
<p><span class="r">Ripley is Different in Resurrection:</span> In Resurrection, we don't get the tired, beaten down Ripley from the previous two movies who somehow manages to persevere and survive. Instead, Weaver takes to her genetic change with a gusto that mixes just the right mix of alien swagger, camp, and tender humanity. Most importantly, Weaver doesn't take herself too seriously here. Ripley's smirks more than anything else make the impossible set-up bearable. Its almost as if she's saying, "Yeah, this is Frankenstein 4, but you knew the monster (me) needed to come back from the dead if there was to be a sequel, right? Just roll with it and we'll be OK." In short, Weaver almost single-handedly makes this sequel work. Ripley's one liners (such as, "Who do I have to fuck to get off this ship?") sometimes even come close to equaling those in Aliens. However, this approach can only go so far - if they ever plan on doing an Alien 5, they're gonna need to revive Abbot and Costello!</p>
<p><img src="http://cyberpunk2021.free.fr/images/review/Alien_4_05.jpg"></p>
<p><span class="r">The Rest of the Cast:</span> While Weaver shines, the same cannot be said of the rest of the cast. Some of the member are really hit or miss, while others fail altogether. Winona Ryder's role was a bit too much for her to pull off. First she had to be a believable mechanic (Kaylee, she's not!), and then had to be an undercover resistance member and finally had to work as a second generation android. I don't know who could have worked all three of these aspects into a coherent whole, but Ryder was not able to pull it off. Although, Ryder does shine in some of the scenes ? especially those that are similar to Ripley's role in the first movie where the Ryder is struggling to maintain sanity when everything is stacked against them. For other examples, Brad Dourif as the crazed scientist is too over the top, and Dan Hadaya as the military commander comes off as a complete imbecile. Two notable standouts are mercenaries Ron Perlman and David St. James ? both turn in very solid and interesting performances.</p>
<p><img src="http://cyberpunk2021.free.fr/images/review/Alien_4_06.jpg"></p>
<p><span class="r">The DNA Mixing:</span> OK, the DNA mixing explanation is just too hokey to work. Joss Whedon deserves some credit for at least not running away from this impossible task ? instead he makes it a centerpiece to the story (but it still doesn't' work ? then again, I don't think anything would). Basically they needed a way of both recreating Ripley will still keeping her memories intact. Their work-around is to state that Ripley's and the Alien's DNAs melded together (I suppose this happened in the lava? Good thing they were able to retrieve it, ey?). OK, fine, but I have a few questions: Aliens are uniquely different from humans but their DNA is so close that its not distinguishable form one another? Or assuming the DNA was melded, how exactly did they know what they were looking at? More to the point, how did they figure out (even with lots of trial and error) to make two completely separate organisms out of the DNA? But even taking the ocean of salt needed to buy that explanation, how is it that an alien organism who grows by eating the material in the lungs is able to read Ripley's memories and retain them? Again, while this clearly is problematic, you really just have to roll with it if you want to enjoy Resurrection.</p>
<p><img src="http://cyberpunk2021.free.fr/images/review/Alien_4_07.jpg"></p>
<p><span class="r">Genetic Manipulation Scare:</span> Probably the scariest aspect of Alien Resurrection is the notion that in the semi-near future, genetics will be advanced enough and so well understood that even your basic crackpot scientists with the right equipment can play Josef Mengele in experimenting with mixing lifeforms to their hearts content. One can imagine a number of variations to this, but the jist of the concern is that its not too far a stretch to imagine that in the near future, less savory governments or corporations may be lured to do various genetic trials of this kind in the pursuit of fame and profit. This concept in Resurrection is as cyberpunk as one can get.</p>
<p><img src="http://cyberpunk2021.free.fr/images/review/Alien_4_08.jpg"></p>
<p><span class="r">The Android:</span> Unfortunately the back story is glossed over, but in Alien Resurrection, the androids have somehow developed a second generation android, one who is not beholden to human command. Not surprisingly humanity targeted them for termination, which caused the remaining second generation androids to burn out their communications devices and go into hiding. In Alien Resurrection, it's the android who holds the tenets of humanity most dear. The android is more concerned with the fate of mankind than all the shallow and flawed humans in this movie. The android is even religious. One wishes this aspect of the androids was explored. If they truly feel that they indeed have a purpose for existence, how is this rationalized, and how have they changed the concept of a human deity to accommodate their self-worth?</p>
<p><img src="http://cyberpunk2021.free.fr/images/review/Alien_4_09.jpg"></p>
<p><span class="r">The Visuals:</span> Director Jeunet and visual effects supervisor Pitof deserve credit for creating some wonderful visuals in Alien Resurrection. Resurrection contintually treats us to some wonderfully composed shots ? shots that far exceed the qualities of the acting. Even if the plot and acting turn you off, the cinematography, wonderful set pieces, models and creature FX will help keep Alien Resurrection bearable. Like many cyberpunk films, a single color dominates the film ? yellow in this case. Yes there are some blacks, but yellow seems to permeate all the key scenes.</p>
<p><img src="http://cyberpunk2021.free.fr/images/review/Alien_4_10.jpg"></p>
<p><span class="r">The Bottom Line:</span> Yes, Alien Resurrection has an extremely problematic story within a flawed movie, but it ends up being more fun than it probably deserves. Even though the rest of the cast doesn't always support her, Sigourney Weaver turns in a terrific performance. This, along with the originality, the wonderful cinematography and FX make Alien Resurrections a step up from Alien 3, and worthy enough to watch. While the cyberpunk elements are subdued, the android along with the genetics and dystopic civilization (destroyed by human wastes and technology) are enough to include it in this site. Alien Resurrection won't flip your world like the first two did, but its still worth a watch.</p></div>
