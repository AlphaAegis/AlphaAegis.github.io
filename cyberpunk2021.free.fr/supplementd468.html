		<h4>Review</h4>
		<p>The war... We hadn't had it yet. What could be nicer as a combat zone than a good old jungle with the possibility to use any kind of weapon without being nab by the cops? This is a scenario that qualifies itself as &quot;strategic&quot;. I'd rather call it &quot;brutish&quot;. A situation scenario, a conflict frame, and hop... pack it up, this is a bulky scenario that would be better suited to a wargame than a RPG. A few rules follow to manage large-scale conflicts (supply, support, movements, troops confrontations, etc). For those who REALLY want this kind of thing in their cyberpunk campaign. As long as they are there, they will find a complement of happiness in Maximum Metal. Once again, Atlas Games remain equal to themselves in mediocrity.</p>
