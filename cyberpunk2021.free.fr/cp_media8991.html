<h3>Synopsis</h3>
<p>Michael and Karen Brace are working on a virtual reality system that sends sensory inputs directly into the brain. When one of the senior workers begins to die of a heart attack and puts on the tape unit, things get more interesting. Michael tries to follow her experiences after death, but is prevented by the authorities when one of their people goes into cardiac arrest trying to follow him. The military take over the project to use the experiences of psychotics and others as training and possibly torture aids. Pornographic experience tapes begin to appear as well. None of this is what they had in mind, and Michael is convinced that he must complete the tape of his friend's death.</p>
