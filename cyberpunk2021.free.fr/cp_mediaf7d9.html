<p><span class="r">Overview:</span> <b>It's not cyberpunk, mkay? No, truly, it's not!</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Yes, it was based on a very good cyberpunk short story written by cyberpunk Godfather, William Gibson,</li>
<li>Yes, New Rose Hotel is on most every list of cyberpunk movies you can find on the internet, some of which are only 10 movies deep,</li>
<li>Yes, this movie seems to be a throwaway mention in about half the cyberstudy reviews of modern cyberpunk movies.</li>
</ul>
<p>Please trust me here - I've seen (and own) at least 95% of all cyberpunk movies currently in production and a very high percentage of the ones out of print (all that I can find out about and get). New Rose Hotel is NOT cyberpunk. <span class="quote">These people are lying to you.</span> I'm betting major bucks that the vast majority of those who have New Rose Hotel mentioned as cyberpunk have never seen it. If they had seen it, New Rose Hotel would not be on their cyberpunk list. Why do I say this?</p>
<ul>
<li>This movie has NO cyberpunk visuals,</li>
<li>This movie has NO interesting philosophical message,</li>
<li>This movie has NO cyberpunk themes embedded in it, and</li>
<li>This movie takes place in modern time, not in a near future.</li>
</ul>
<p>On top of its lack of cyberpunknesss, New Rose Hotel as a movie is boring as shit! Ferrara needs an award for taking a high quality cast consisting of Christopher Walken, Willem Dafoe (both of whom I LOVE as actors) and Asia Argento and producing this steaming pile of dung!</p>
<p><span class="r">The story:</span> So what's it about, you ask? Dafoe and Walken try to use a hooker (Argento) to convince a high profile geneticist to defect from one corporation to another. If they do, they pocket major bucks! In short, things go bad after an affair develops between Dafoe and Argento. But the bottom line is nobody watching this cares as the story as the cinematography and the acting are poorly enacted and uninspired. Worse, the last 15 minutes involves replaying of scenes from the first half of the movie. Why? For absolutely NO reason! Believe me when say that I look for meaning in films even when there isn't really a basis - there was absolutely no reason for the flashbacks.<br><br>
Truly, this movie sucks on just about every aspect of movie making one can imagine. But I really don't berate it for this reason - I intensely hate the fact that everyone has engaged in a cow-like groupthink in continually mentioning this as one of the main cyberpunk movies out. New Rose Hotel is only interesting in that it seems to have turned into a virus meme, infecting as many as possible with the mistaken belief that it's something worthy of mention. As punishment for New Rose Hotel's atrocities against good cyberpunk, I've dropped it a few stars in my rating (if I was unbiased, I might have given it a 3 out of 10 star rating). So in closing:<br><br>
<span class="r"><i>Memo to other movie sites who have this listed as cyberpunk</i>:</span> Admit it, you haven't seen it. Please remove New Rose Hotel from your cyberpunk movie list.<br><br>
<span class="r"><i>Memo to cyberstudies researchers who list this movie as a representative cyberpunk movie</i>:</span> Please remove it. There at minimum 80 movies which would come before New Rose Hotel as far better examples of cyberpunk. If you are looking for specific movies to back up a particular point you are trying to prove, just drop me a line, and I'll be happy to provide you detailed assistance in selecting more appropriate movies. Just PLEASE stop spreading the belief that this movie is cyberpunk!<br><br>
And um, yes, there are MANY other selections due for a rant like this. Escape from New York, anyone?</p></div>
