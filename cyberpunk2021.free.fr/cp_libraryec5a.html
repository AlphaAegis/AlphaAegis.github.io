<h1>Blade Runner: A Movie</h1>
</center><br>
<div class="c">
<p><i>Blade Runner: A Movie</i> is a science fiction screenplay by William S. Burroughs. It was released in 1979.</p>
<p>In this trenchant science-fiction screen treatment, William S.Burroughs outlines the coming apocalypse in medical care, a Dante-esque horror show, brought to a boil by a mutated virus and right-wing politics, set in a future not nearly far enough away.</p>
<p>Not to be confused with Ridley Scott's movie <i>Blade Runner</i>. In fact, Scott's film -- a screen adaptation of Philip K.Dick's 1968 science fiction novel <i>Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?</i> -- was retitled Blade Runner with a tip of the hat to William Burroughs (who, in turn, acknowledges Alan E.Nourse, &quot;upon whose book The Blade Runner, characters and situations in this book [Burroughs'] are based&quot;). To make things even more convoluted, subsequent editions of Dick's book have been reprinted under the name Blade Runner in order to tie-in with the motion picture.</p>
<br>
<h3>Synopsis</h3>
<p>In this futuristic screenplay vision of a strife-and-disease-plagued America in 1999, Burroughs finds the cure for a decaying civilization in the medicine practiced by underground physicians and surgeons. These heroic healers, in turn, are aided by &quot;blade runners&quot;, teenagers who smuggle banned surgical instruments past the watchful eyes of fascistic police. The novel-cum-screenplay follows follows one of these runners during the course of a race riot and the transfer of instruments between embattled doctors. Above the drama in the streets of New York is a world &quot;taken over by hang-glider and autogyro gangs, mountaineers and steeplejacks. A sky boy steps off his penthouse into a parachute on guide wires that drop him to a street-level landing... Meanwhile, released animals and reptiles from the zoo and freed fish from the aquarium have control of the rovers and subways&quot;. The prose flashes with Burrough's own brand of outrageousness and fantasy.</p>
