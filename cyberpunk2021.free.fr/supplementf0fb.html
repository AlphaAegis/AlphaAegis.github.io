		<h4>Review</h4>
		<p>Phew, finally ! Such is the cry pushed by many cyberpunk GMs when this supplement came out. Finally a REAL background for Cyberpunk. It's a bit late, but better late than never. So for those of you who, unlike me, haven't lost patience and created your own background, here's something to keep your 21st century America alive. Everything is detailed : life, customs, economy, religions and politics of the country (this one being unfortunately a bit overlooked). Each state is described individually. In spite of this encyclopedic character, some aspects are in my opinion a little regrettable : 35 pages devoted to the American army is a lot ! Moreover, a lot of things are quite unrealistic : in 30 years, how did they create so many new cities, new religions, etc ? Anyway, in my opinion, there are some things to take and to leave in this supplement, but it is in any case indispensable for a GM wishing to play in the USA.</p>
