<p><i>Overdrawn at the Memory Bank</i> is a science fiction movie directed by Douglas Williams.</p>
<br>
<h3>Synopsis</h3>
<p>Raul Julia plays Aram Fingal, a very intelligent computer programmer and a very bored man in the employ of Novicorp, a mega-corporation that exists somewhere in the future. When caught watching &quot;Casablanca&quot; at his desk, Fingal is required to undergo rehabilitation therapy called &quot;doppling&quot;. Doppled patients find their minds transferred into the bodies of animals for a new outlook on life (and for a number of amusing nature documentary sequences narrated by Julia). However, Fingal's body is misplaced and he is transferred into a computer while the body is located. With the help of Appolonia James, a medical technician played by Linda Griffiths, Fingal manages to reprogram himself into a simulation of Casablanca and eventually gains access to Novicorp's financial computers, bringing the company to its knees. But Fingal's real problem is getting back into his body before his memory patterns are erased.</p>
