"We had such potential. Such promise. But we squandered our gifts. And so, 9, I am creating you. Our world is ending. Life must go on."</p>
<p><span class="r">Overview:</span> Tim Burton sees Shane Acker's short and helps to make it a feature length move about 9 robotic rag dolls, a.k.a. the "stitchpunks", who are left to fight the machines that exterminated humanity. Together, the stitchpunks must find a way to pull the plug on the nightmare creations (without John Connor's help) that have turned their attention to the them.</p>
<p>The story of <i>9</i> may not be the most complex, but the straight-forward approach does work with the CGI effects, though the backstory of how the world got into the sorry shape it is in helps makes the doll's fight more relevant.</p>
<p><span class="r">The Story:</span> In an unnamed country, a scientist creates the B.R.A.I.N., an AI that was supposed to help humanity. But the country's chancellor forces the scientist to install the B.R.A.I.N. in a fabrication machine, which is used to create machines of war. The machine rebels and launches a massive war that exterminates humanity. The scientist, the last human left, creates the 9 "stitchpunks" (Acker's name for the rag doll-bots) and infuses them with a "life force". When 9 is complete, the scientist dies, leaving it to find the other stitchpunks in their quest to stop the machines.</p>
<p><span class="r">A stitchpunk in time saves... 1 through 8. </span>The other stitchpunks he finds are: #1 - the "leader" of the group, who shows much cynicism regarding 9's plans to rescue #2, the inventor of the group who gets captured early on.<br>
Numbers 3 and 4 are twins who hide out in a library. Through them, we learn of the machine's war against humanity.<br>
5 is a journeyman who was trained by 2. He is missing an eye due an attack during the war.<br>
6 can probably be best described as an "artist" whose paintings are clues about the machines.<br>
7 is the only female in the group. An agile warrior who wears a bird's skull as a helmet.<br>
8 is a big but dumb brute who acts as 1's bodyguard. He give a slight clue that the stitchpunks may be robotic when he uses a magnet near his head like a mind-altering drug.</p>

<p><span class="r">But, is it cyberpunk? </span>Some might question if <i>9</i> is cyberpunk enough to review here, but from what I've seen (and from the definition on this site), there's enough to make it cyberpunk; The negative impact of technology (the machine revolt), the man-machine fusion (the scientist transferring his life force to the stitchpunks), the underground (stitchpunks), and the visual style (the post-apocalypse scene and darkness occasionally punctured by light). The only things missing are the access to information and the control over society, though the machine threat could cover the control aspect. Can this be called steampunk? Possibly, though no signs of steam-power is immediately seen. Can this be called "stitchpunk?" Only the doll-bots should be called that.</p>
<p><img src="http://cyberpunk2021.free.fr/images/review/9_03.jpg"></p>
<p><span class="r">Conclusion:</span> Those looking for a deep storyline are going to be disappointed. Those who prefer bleeding-edge eye-candy will have a ball with <i>9</i>. Those looking for a good cyberpunk movie, this should hold you... until <i>Surrogates</i> hits the screens next week.</p></div>
