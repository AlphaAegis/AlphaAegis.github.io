<div class="c">
<p>Bruce Bethke is a writer and computer consultant who lives and works in quiet, suburban, Pig's Eye Landing, Minnesota. He is the author of more than 40 published short stories and some 200 computer-related articles and technical manuals. His fiction has appeared in magazines ranging from <i>Aboriginal</i> to <i>Weird Tales</i> and has been translated into eight languages at last count, while his nonfiction has been proven under laboratory conditions to induce a safe and restful sleep. His 1995 novel, <i>Headcrash</i>, won the prestigious Philip K. Dick Award for Best American Novel, and has since been rediscovered to be a latent &quot;Pynchonesque&quot; mainstream novel.</p>
<p>Bruce Bethke is the coiner of the word &quot;cyberpunk&quot;. The word appeared first time ever as a title of his short science fiction story <i>Cyberpunk</i> in 1980.</p>
