<a id="i10"></a><h2>1. Introduction</h2>
<img src="interface/GITS_InfoAge_01.jpg">
<p>Forget everything you know about computers. Forget everything you know about the internet. Everything changed with the Cyber revolution. Most people don't even own computers. They own terminals. With massive networks of billions of computers and cyberbrains, the population now shares a common information database. The size of the internet's shareable knowledge increased exponentially, squaring in size every five years until finally, at the beginning of the this decade, the total bytes of knowledge on the global net, written on paper, would fill up the solar system.</p>
<p>With no centralized hub, the net found itself powered by the brains of the cyberized users accessing it every day. Information stopped being relayed over wire, replaced with satellite and cellular towers. There was no place on earth where the net did not exist. If one person with a Cyberbrain lived there, the net would expand to meet it. Everything anyone has ever conceived about the net has passed, replaced with new ideals the previous generation hadn't even conceived. People could recall every moment of their lives, upload it to a storable medium, and remember those moments at any time. They could talk virtually in binary with a computer, their brains running faster than anyone could possible type. Gone are the days of MAPCON CMMS software and large database maintenance programs. Like everything else CMMS software is controlled by the Cyberbrain and companies have discontinued their use of old CMMS software databases. Soon, you either got yourself a cyberbrain, or you found yourself as much an antique as a Neanderthal is now. You advanced, or you stepped aside.</p>
<p>In this future, everyone involved with the modern information age possesses a cyberbrain. However, this resulted in information-related crime increasing by a factor relating to information's growth. As crime increased, the need for defense increased as well. Soon, firewalls not only defended secured computer drives, but our own brains as well. As hackers became more and more prevalent, their powers increased. Soon, they could breach into firewalls and alter someone's perception... and later, their own memories. Barriers emerged to combat these new crimes. Barriers exist as active firewalls in both cyberbrains and external memories as well as all forms of Artificial Intelligence. Barriers exist in two levels, the surface monitors the cybernetic relationship with the outside world. It regulates communication with external sources. Some communication is required so that net access is possible. The second barrier is the unspoken Ghost Barrier. Part of this is the simple transition from digital information to organic memory, the rest is a technological barrier blocking people from diving to much into someone brains. Of course, one could let them if they want. Accessing and altering are two very different situations.</p>
<p>In old stories, hackers would steal, delete, copy and alter information. In the end, that's all they could do. Now, hackers can alter perceptions, generate reality, fabricate memories, and even hijack someone's own mind. Hackers in the future are a robust bunch. They operate on both sides of the fence, defenders and attackers. Some simply dive to steal secrets... to know more. Some dive because of a need to connect... to simply have the access and freedom to go anywhere and see anything. Others dive for control. They want to be able to dominate... In this world... you don't have to be big... to be in control. Now the smallest and weakest person can control the masses... all he needs is a connection and the talent to go where he does not belong.</p>
<p>Thankfully, they are still more defenders than attackers and most cyberbrains will live through their existence never knowing a hack attack. The basic Firewalls are more than enough to regulate information and keep the spammers out. But the miscreants are out there. The most feared are the super-class A hackers. Rumors point there may be less than a dozen world-wide. The hackers can alter the mind in ways only god is known to do. They can totally re-write someone's experiences, even change their personality. Most of all... they can Ghost Dive... actually swim around in someone else's subconscious, see what they want, change what they will, and disregard the rest. Barriers get better... and so do the hackers. Now barriers can strike back, confuse, or even kill their attackers. Every policing agency on the planet have sections for cybercrime.</p>
<img src="interface/GITS_InfoAge_02.jpg">
<p>Digital information truly flows through the planet now. Surfing the net in the new age is as different as talking on the phone is to the dawn of the internet at the end of the last century. In the future everything is cyberized... everything is computerized... Everything can be controlled. Nothing is safe.<br>
The net is vast... and populated...</p>

<a id="i11"></a><h3>Cyberbrains</h3>
<p>The approximation of mobile media to physical human body started with portable then wearable terminals, and finally settled to implantable terminals, which ushered civilization into a new era where man and machine were no longer separate. Such integration was realized by direct transplanting of communication terminals to the physical body, allowing the body and mind to interact immediately with standard computer and network technology. These implantables gradually took over the outdated portable/wearable technology, to be recognized as the prototype of cyberbrain. After the ever-growing technology introduced the practical utility of micro-machines, cyberbrains became both safe and inexpensive. This caused rapid popularization of cyberbrains within countries that had little or no religion restrictions, such as Japan.</p>
<p>But the wide prevalence of cyberbrains caused social anxiety : people were exposed to risks of brain-hack because of their neural connection to the entire population using cyberbrains. The most serious brain-hacking crime was &quot;Ghost Hack&quot;, a case where total individuality including past memories and body discretion of a certain person became the subject of the hacker. Various countermeasures were taken, such as the development of numerous protective walls and barriers along with reinforcement of regulations, not to mention security intensification within the neural network system. But they failed to abolish cyber-crimes, thus resulting in a rat race : further development of protective walls and barriers, and the emergence of more intelligent and original hackers.</p>
<p><i>-- Yoshiki Sakurai</i></p>

<a id="i12"></a><h3>Moving through the Net</h3>
<p>Against prior knowledge in older, outdated science fiction, one does not actually move anywhere. The graphical representation of the net is a purely optional experience, sometimes used when hackers dive into access ports into secured areas. However, the space and the icons are purely reflective. There is no movement. People rarely create avatars and most hacking attacks have no graphical interpretation. The Hollywood route simply does not take place.<br>
Hacking requires no map, no icons. The only real extent of imagery are when penetrating InterGates to get into memories. Beyond that, graphics are purely optional. One first must locate the memory, then try to push through the barriers... then they can initiate an attack. Once one is past the barrier, they are free to do what they want. In fact, the target may not even know they are being attacked.</p>
<br>
<a id="i20"></a><h2>2. General principles</h2>
<a id="i21"></a><h3>a. Statistics and defense</h3>
<p><b>Statistics :</b> the most important statistics to access the Net are Intelligence (INT) and Technical Ability (TECH). Your TECH save (1D10 roll under your TECH) will allow you to avoid some effects of hack attacks.<br>
- Your TECH is the basis of your barriers during attacks and of all defensive rolls on the Net in general.<br>
- Your INT is used to recognize attacks, execute them and infiltrate barriers using the Interface and System Knowledge skills. Finally, it defines your effectiveness in cyber fighting (by determining how many and which attacks you can use).<br>
Nevertheless, your INT and TECH can be damaged during fighting on the Net. This will affect your efficiency for the future as your number of attacks will be reduced.</p>
<p><b>Barrier Defense :</b> your Barrier Defense is a fixed number like your SP. Although a person may not be aware that they are under attack, this number will not be decreased. It is split into two, Surface Defense and Ghost Defense. You can own several barriers but they do not increase the value of Defense, they are just additional defenses to be bypassed by the hacker before accessing your data.</p>
<p><b>Surface Defense (SD) :</b> this defense is used to defend against attempts to penetrate the interface connecting a cyberbrain with the outside (audio, visual, tactile, etc). This barrier is necessarily partially open to allow communication with the Net. Removing this defense allows the hacker to more or less alter the target's perceptions (depending on the attacks used).</p>
<p>Surface barrier : 10 + TECH + barrier value + possible bonuses</p>
<p><b>Ghost Defense (GD) :</b> always higher than Surface Defense, this barrier protects the Ghost and its memory from external attacks. Like all firewalls, it can be dropped willingly to let someone access specific memories. It is also able to counter-attack thanks to its active defenses. You must bypass the surface barrier(s) before attempting to pass the Ghost barrier(s).</p>
<p>Ghost barrier : 15 + TECH + barrier value + possible bonuses</p>

<a id="i22"></a><h3>b. One skill, multiple uses</h3>
<p>A netrunner is more or less gifted or specialized in certain hacking operations and knows some types of targets better than others. To represent this we will divide the Interface skill into ten Commands and ten Targets. Each Command and Target will have a value from 1 to 5 and will denote the expertise and softwares the netrunner has to attack a given target, or perform certain tasks. The netrunner will distribute its Interface x 10 between these different Targets and Commands.<br>
For example : for an Interface skill of 8, 80 points to be distributed between its 10 Targets and 10 Commands (giving a value of 1 to 5 to each).</p>

<h3>List of Targets and Commands</h3>
<b>Commands :</b>
<ul>
<li>Locate : find physically or virtually.</li>
<li>Information : search for information on the subject (version, manufacturer, etc).</li>
<li>Discretion : camouflage to prevent detection.</li>
<li>Edit/Delete : alter the target or its programming.</li>
<li>Control : take control and execute normal operations of the target.</li>
<li>Infiltrate : get access without permission, override a target's security.</li>
<li>Secure/Defend : prevent infiltration, modification or control of the target by a third party. Also allows to defend during a cyber fight.</li>
<li>Encryption : making the target undecipherable by a third party.</li>
<li>Decryption : decrypting an encrypted target.</li>
<li>Execute/Attack : execute a software (virus, ICE) in a controlled system. Also allows to attack during a cyber fight.</li>
</ul>
<b>Targets :</b>
<ul>
<li>Memory/File : obvious.</li>
<li>Cyber : cybernetics.</li>
<li>Comm. : any digital communication system (phone, cyberbrain link, wired network, etc).</li>
<li>Sensor : hardware to acquire/measure data (camera, microphone, heat, touch, motion sensor, etc).</li>
<li>Radio-controlled : mobile system operating under the control of a user or a remote system (e.g. drone).</li>
<li>Network interface : hardware used to interface a user or a system with the Net (CyberModem, network interface of a cyberbrain, etc).</li>
<li>Vehicle : obvious.</li>
<li>Weapon : weapon controlled by an electronic system (smartgun, smartlink, etc).</li>
<li>System : operating system (OS) of an electronic hardware.</li>
<li>User/Sysop/netrunner/IA : human (or Artificial Intelligence) connected to the system or hardware.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note: in the rest of the document we will refer to these half-skills by the terms Command() and Target().</p>
<p><b>How to use it :</b> for each action taken by the netrunner, he will choose a Command and a Target and add the value he has put in each one to determine the total value of his skill for that action. Example : if a netrunner has Locate(4) and Vehicle(3), his skill will be 7 to try to find a car via the location systems on the Net.</p>
<p><b>Roll :</b> INT + Command() + Target() + 1D10 which has to beat a Difficulty (Diff) which will often depend on the type of target.</p>
<p>When the Interface skill increases by one point, the netrunner distributes 10 points among the 20 Commands and Targets (within the limit of 1 to 5).</p>
As a general rule we will follow this model :
<table>
<tr><td><b>Difficulty</b></td><td><b>Target example</b></td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Street-front public or corporate website</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Low-security target (school or SMB network)</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Personal computer connected to the Net (fixed station)</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>Corporate, police, government agency non-public networks</td></tr>
<tr><td>35+</td><td>Top-secret corporate and military servers and networks</td></tr>
</table>

<a id="i23"></a><h3>c. Preparing for a netrun</h3>
<p>A netrunner can slightly modulate its array of programs, viruses and optimizations at the beginning of a netrun. He can temporarily transfer two levels of his skill in one Target to another Target (same for Commands). He can do this as many times as he wants. This preparation takes about ten minutes and therefore cannot usually be done in the middle of an infiltration and certainly not in the middle of a fight.</p>
<img src="interface/GITS_InfoAge_03.jpg">

<a id="i24"></a><h3>d. Initiative and physical combat</h3>
<p>Things are going on the Net much faster than in reality. A netrunner will therefore make an initiative roll each round (just like fighters), but he will usually have double the number of actions for the same duration (3 seconds round). The fastest netrunners are able to perform up to 10 actions per round. Of course, the more actions you perform, the more malus for each one (like in a normal fight).</p>
<p><b>Netrun initiative :</b> INT + Interface + Speed + 1D10 (2D10 and more for some cyberbrains)<br>
The netrunner generally has 2 actions for every 10 initiative points (0-10 : 2 actions, 11-20 : 4 actions, etc). For the physical fight, it is 1 action per 10 points.<br>
On the other hand, unlike the -3 malus for each additional physical action, virtual actions cost only one malus point each. Taking 2 netrun actions for a round does not result in a malus (unless cumulated with physical actions), taking 4 results in a -4 malus, 6 in a -6 malus, etc.</p>
<p>If a netrunner is interfaced and wants to hack while in physical combat, he will have to launch a netrun initiative and a normal initiative to know when to act in each world. He will get a malus on all actions according to the number of actions performed (physical + virtual).<br>
For example : with an roll of 15 in physical initiative and 25 in netrun initiative, this allows a maximum of 2 physical actions and 6 virtual actions. Performing all these actions in 3 seconds would result in a malus of -12 on all rolls! On the other hand, if the netrunner is hiding behind a dumpster and only deals with hacking, his 6 netrun actions would only be at -6 each.</p>

<a id="i30"></a><h2>3. Software</h2>
<p>A netrunner programs its own software (viruses, electronic countermeasures, packet sniffers, code crackers, decryptors, logic bombs, etc). All programs on the market are identified and barriers sense them coming before they can do anything. These homemade programs are already counted in the skill level (Command and Target), but a netrunner can also program something specific before going under fire <b>if he has information about the target</b>. He can also buy disposable software from another netrunner but only once, because as soon as the attack is deployed, the adaptive barriers will build a specific defense, and communicate it to the rest of the Net in less than an hour. Programming takes time, but can be a great help for the attack that will follow.</p>
<p>Programming yourself requires a Library Search roll (as in Locate), then a System Knowledge roll, and finally a Programming roll. Add the margins of success of these three rolls (against the specific difficulty of the target type). The total of the success margins divided by 5 is the total bonus granted by this program for this attack (for all rolls, including the Locate roll). For each +1 of this bonus it is necessary to spend two hours of preparation.<br>
The program can also be purchased, each +1 of the program costing 500 eb (negotiable of course).</p>

<a id="i31"></a><h3>a. Viruses</h3>
<p>Viruses come in many shapes and forms. They are so prevalent, that to detail all the rules of all the functions of viruses, it would take up its own book. What are listed here are various ways to create and implement basic viruses. Generally, to construct a virus, the programmer makes a Programming roll. Each roll results in one hour of programming time. Each DC reflects how complicated the virus is and how many functionalities the programmer can attempt to incorporate.</p>
<img src="interface/GITS_InfoAge_07.jpg">
<p><b>Making a vaccine :</b> a computer virus is like an organic virus. A vaccine can be made to counteract is effects. The vaccine is a program that erases the virus and its harmful effects (unless they are permanent). The create a virus requires a Programming roll that beats the roll the designer used to create it. It also requires at least one hour per roll. However, an original copy of the virus is required - either a virus that has infected someone or copy from the source. The vaccine can then be sent to all parties involved. Vaccines are programs that do not rewrite any data on the cyberbrain, but hunt down programs that do not belong. As a result, it is a surface action and does not need to break through barriers to work.</p>
<p><b>Virus ID :</b> having a copy of the virus and decompiling it also results in an specific ID template of the programmer. It does not reveal names or phone numbers. The ID is simply the pattern of programming. If two viruses by the same programmer are placed side by side, enough similarities emerge to connect them. This ID cannot be changed because it is not really an ID, just a pattern of programming.</p>
<p><b>Using viruses :</b> viruses almost have skills on their own. They carry a Interface skill = to the programmer's  5. They have a number of Hack Attacks also equal to their programmer. They cannot swap any attacks from their memory. Choose the actions and how they will operate in order. The virus cannot deviate from their list or their order. Virus can be implanted or used to hack. If they are used to hack, they do so with a reduced ability of course, but it saves the cyberbrain from Intelligence damage. A virus that gets hit with any damage is instantly vaporized. A cyberbrain can only contain a number of viruses equal to INT/2. The virus cannot be implanted with actions the programmer. The programmer must also roll to succeed in the action as if doing the action herself when programming it. A success implants the program successfully. Failure results in time loss. Remember, every roll, regardless of success or failure, takes an hour.<br>
The actions implemented cannot cause INT damage as there is no power in the virus to cause such a feedback unless given the Strike function. Viruses get no bonuses for direct connection via QRS or a Total Immersion Harness.<br>
Example : Nanao A used a Delayed Action virus with a Military Command Encryption Key to take control of security guards and attempt an assassination. The memory required is a Basic one (Delayed Action 5 + Databank 2 + Basic 15 = 22). Its danger resided with Nanoa's Programming skill and the fact the Databank had the Command Encryption Key).</p>
<p><b>Cellular Suicide Program :</b> a murder program that triggers the apoptosis function in every cell of the body, and by inducing this, leads to a person's death. To make micromachine rice (MM-rice) suitable for every environment, biological phenomena were overwritten at a genetic level, and as an application of this, it is possible to intentionally trigger apoptosis (planned cellular death as part of the immune system), something that has always been present in all cells. If rice that the cellular suicide program has been spliced into is taken in and absorbed into the human body, when the program is activated, apoptosis occurs, and the person dies.</p>

<a id="i32"></a><h3>b. Virus types & functions</h3>
<ul>
<li><b>Virus type :</b> directly related to how many different actions the virus can have.</li>
<li><b>Functions :</b> each virus can be given as many functions as need be, increasing its difficulty and time to completion.</li>
<li><b>Difficulty :</b> Programming roll required to successfully program the virus.</li>
<li><b>Memory :</b> how many different actions the virus can have.</li>
</ul><table align="center"><tr><td><table>
<tr><th>Virus type</th><th>Time</th><th>Memory</th></tr>
<tr><td>Basic</td><td>15</td><td>2</td></tr>
<tr><td>Complex</td><td>20</td><td>4</td></tr>

<tr><td>Relay</td><td>+2</td></tr>
<tr><td>Strike</td><td>+5</td></tr>
<tr><td>Toy Bomb</td><td>+3</td></tr>
<tr><td>Tracer</td><td>+2</td></tr>
<tr><td>Trash Bomb</td><td>+2</td></tr></table></td></tr></table>
<p><b>Databank :</b> Databank is a section of the virus that contains information. This could release at a specific moment or be used as a storage area. A virus may attack areas to retrieve information or could already have information the virus is programmed to release. The Databank may also be used to store useful information the virus requires to operate (like a Command Encryption Key).</p>
<p><b>Delayed Action :</b> a virus that will activate only when a time is reached or a command given. The virus must be able to receive the command (so it cannot receive it through a locked off cyberbrain for example).</p>
<p><b>Evolution :</b> an updated and newer version of the HA virus. Evolution viruses have twice the number of actions contained in memory and can interchange these additional actions with those in memory at any time. Additional, the Evolution no longer has to attack in order and can thus use any of its attacks in any order.</p>
<p><b>HA-1 :</b> H-A (Hyper-Attack) viruses are attack viruses that are exempt from being fixed in their memory or attack order (see below). They can swap out attacks like normal cyberbrains. HA-1 carries a spare memory of 1 additional action and can swap into its memory instantly before the action comes up.</p>
<p><b>HA-3 :</b> HA-3 has 3 spare memories.</p>
<p><b>HA-5 :</b> HA-5 has 5 spare memories.</p>
<p><b>MicroMachine :</b> Micromachine viruses are a very rare and dangerous breed. These are Micromachines that carry the virus instead of the virus being transmitted digitally. Micromachine viruses circumvent all surface barriers altogether and attack the cyberbrain directly. They are difficult to handle and must use two memory spaces. They cannot transmit their viruses. Micromachines must be placed in the body, either through a syringe or ingested through food. Specific Micromachines must be purchased (500 eb). Some MicroMachine viruses can actually effect organics as well.</p>
<p><b>Modular :</b> similar to Toy Bombs, they are disguised in e-mails or picture file header data, and when certain conditions are met, they compile into a single program. In the &quot;Laughing Man&quot; attack on the Superintendent-General, one of these was slipped into the security detail and stored inside their cyberbrains. The Modular virus finishes its attack profile and then transmits itself to another target, usually the same type. The programmer must use one memory space detailing the target and the range from the previous one. A modular virus can, for example, target all robots in a factory but only those. It will continually attack the target and not move onto the next one until the first one is finished.</p>
<p><b>Pandora's Box :</b> any virus that when opened will start up and do what the virus is made to do. It is similar to the Toy Bomb except it does not require a Interface roll to &quot;disguise&quot; itself but it cannot be equipped with a Delayed Action function. It must be downloaded or implanted and cannot be transmitted in.</p>
<p><b>Probe :</b> this is a violation of the Telecommunications Bureau. A virus that attacks every nearby system in a 150 meters in order to find a specific one. However, it only locates something. No attack actions can be incorporated.</p>
<p><b>Relay :</b> the Relay function transmits data back to another source, either a cyberbrain, server, or external memory. This can relay information that the virus stores on a Databank, or it can relay location data from a tracer virus.</p>
<p><b>Strike :</b> normal viruses cannot cause actually damage to a target (electrical feedback or temporary/permanent brain damage). However, strike viruses can, but are only half as effective. Like cyberbrains, viruses need to have a power source to initiate the strike (connected to a terminal).</p>
<p><b>Toy Bomb :</b> like a virus, it is actually concealed as an icon or image file. It sits in plain view until the conditions are met (usually clicked). Toy Bombs must be accepted by the cyberbrain, the AI or by the user downloading it into a memory. The advantage of this is that it requires no hacking to download the virus into memory. On the other hand, the programmer has to perform an Interface roll, the result of which is the disguise value of the Toy Bomb... that value is the Difficulty to spot the bomb for what it is.</p>
<p><b>Tracer :</b> locates where someone is hacking from. Upload the virus into somewhere where someone is hacking into or remotely accessing and it tracks the source. This function takes up additional memory space. It performs an Interface roll in opposition to that of the target. If it beats the hacker, it locates the hacker. If it has any other attacks, it can do that as well. If added with the relay function, it can send that information back to the programmer, allowing the programmer to directly hack the target.</p>
<p><b>Trash Bomb :</b> is any virus that when deleted will start up and do what virus was made to do.</p>
<a id="i40"></a><h2>4. Hardware</h2>
<p>Most netrunners in 2040 use their cyberbrain for their &quot;work&quot; because a cyberbrain is much faster than a cybermodem (the preferred tool of netrunners in the 20s) or a computer. It is nevertheless possible to use these obsolete devices with the following maluses :<br>
- Cybermodem : all Interface and netrun initiative rolls are at -5 unless attacking another cybermodem.<br>
- Terminal/computer : all Interface and netrun initiative rolls are at -10.<br>
However, these devices are less dangerous because they have circuit breakers that protect the netrunner from electric feedback damage. It goes without saying that attacking an obsolete target from a cyberbrain gives a bonus to the Interface roll instead of a malus.</p>
<p>Using a cyberbrain with a wireless connection limits bandwidth, resulting in a -5 malus for the Interface rolls and for the initiative. It is therefore recommended to use an interface cable and a fixed terminal for the most difficult missions. On the other hand, with wireless, the chances of damage are lower (direct electric feedback doesn't work, but the enemy can follow your trail and infiltrate your cyberbrain and Ghost, and damage you).</p>
<p>However, using a cyberbrain with multiple QRS interface jacks gives the netrunner a definite advantage : +2 per additional QRS cable, up to a maximum of 4 cables (maximum bonus of +6 therefore). On the other hand, using multiple cables increases the damage considerably during an electric feedback attack (each additional cable adds 1D6 points of damage).</p>
<p>The wireless connection of a cyberbrain is done via terrestrial relays located everywhere in &quot;civilized&quot; areas. It's another story in the bush. In these relay-free zones, only a satellite connection will be able to connect a cyberbrain to the Net. The cost of such an equipment is 5000 eb.</p>

<a id="i41"></a><h3>a. Cyberbrains</h3>
<p>Bonuses provided by cyberbrains :</p>

<p><b>Barrier Breaker :</b> a program with a preset number of hacking keys to get through barriers. Barrier breaker can't really break through barriers as more they go through their hacking keys to find one that works. When someone uses a barrier breaker against a barrier, he gains a +2D6 bonus to his next three attack rolls. After that, the barrier breaker offers no help to that specific barrier although it can be used on others.</p>
<p><b>Cyberbrain Partition :</b> a cyberbrain partition sections off portions of ones memories and Ghost, to lesson the effects of physical attacks. There is little downside other than it's cost. Physical damage from cyberbrain attacks through viruses or electrical feedback (temporary or permanent INT damage) are halved.</p>
<p><b>CyberHarness :</b> a fully system that allows a deeper dive into the net. It offers a +10 to Interface, Library Search and System Knowledge.</p><p align="center" class="i"><img src="interface/GITS_InfoAge_05.jpg"><img src="interface/GITS_InfoAge_05b.jpg"></p>
<p><b>Dummy Barrier :</b> a forced disconnect device used by placing it between a QRS plug and a terminal. It detects a physical attack via an offensive virus while the user is wired. It physically ejects the wire that connects the user and the subject or absorbs the shock but acting like a cyberbrain and taking the jolt. Each time a physical attack comes through, there is 25% chance the dummy barrier will short out, rendering it useless. It will still absorb that attack but then no others. If the barrier survives, it functions perfectly the next time with no loss in function. It just needs to be reset. While diving through a dummy barrier, all Interface and Initiative checks suffer -5 penalty.</p>
<p><b>Ice Breaker :</b> the Ice breaks down defensive barriers. It is a program that acts on its own to find weaknesses in barrier defenses. It can only be used on Passive barriers. If used against an attack barrier, the Military defense would detect the probe and fry the program. It incurs a -2D4 penalty on the Passive Barrier's defense bonus on the next three rounds.</p>
<p><b>Memory Player :</b> the memory player is a headset system that allows one to replay back visual and aural data back recorded from either an external memory or from a cyberbrain. It offers no bonus to skill rolls, simply recreates a recorded memory in detail for someone else to experience.</p><p align="center" class="i"><img src="interface/GITS_InfoAge_06.jpg"><img src="interface/GITS_InfoAge_06b.jpg"></p>
<p><b>QRS Plug :</b> a simple one meter cable for connecting a cyberbrain to another QRS plug.</p>
<p><b>Retractable QRS Plug :</b> connected to a cyberbrain, it offers a convenient and speedy way of connecting a cyberbrain.</p>
<p><b>Regenerator :</b> although permanent INT damage is... permanent, a regenerator can bring back most damage at the loss of some knowledge. The regenerator recovers 1D2 lost INT each time its used but every time it is used, the recipient looses x2 of that amount in Int based skills points.</p>
<a id="i44"></a><h3>d. Barrier</h3>
<p> Barriers are the only line of defense between the cyberbrain and the vast network beyond. One can have as many barriers as their TECH/2 statistic (minimum 2, 1 Surface, 1 Ghost). Some can have double or triple barriers. External memories, servers or AIs have no barrier limit although few ever go above five. All characters receive a passive level 1 barrier for surface and Ghost automatically for free when they receive their cyberbrain. Additional barriers or upgrading cost money. The Barriers Defense bonus is added to the Total Barrier Defense that hackers must be to be able to cross to access the cyberbrain.</p><table align="center" width=650>

<p><b>Shifting Ghost Defense and Surface Defense :</b> if one is especially paranoid of one barrier being breached over another, they can move their Barrier Defense around. The barrier defense listed below is added to both Ghost and Surface Barrier Defense numbers. However, upon purchase, one can shift up to half the amount of one side to the other. Example : a Beta barrier offers a +8 bonus to both Surface and Ghost Defense. Upon purchase the user can shift up to 4 from either side and move it to the other (+4/+12).</p>

<b>Barrier types :</b>
<ul>
<li><b>Military attack barrier :</b> if you fail in your attempt to break the barrier, it responds by attacking back. Usually attack barriers are so difficult, you need a wire connection to succeed, allowing feedback power surges. Attack barriers respond if the cyberbrain is conscious (active) or not and thus, have their own base rank that all their Interface / System Knowledge rolls are attempted from (add this to a 1D10 rolls for all skill checks). It is quite obvious that this kind of firewalls are only sold to the military, but one should be able to find them on the black market. All Attack Barriers automatically have &quot;Temporary Brain Damage&quot; and &quot;Permanent Brain Damage&quot; as their attacks and can pull them off without rolling for success.</li><br>
<li><b>Maze barrier :</b> instead of being false image of a cyberbrain, the maze barrier makes anyone trying to dive into a brain go through a massive puzzle of simulated experiences, making the journey long and tiresome. Maze barriers may be attack or passive and come with a Maze Rank. The amount the hacker beat the barrier defense by is subtracted by the Maze Rank. The result is how many rounds the hacker must use to navigate the maze, trying to find the way out. After that time is up, they must reroll against the barrier defense again. Failure results in expulsion from the cyberbrain (and damage if from attack barrier). Success finds the route through the maze into the source. Maze barriers have a multiplier rather than cost as it is modified onto existing passive or attack barriers. Maze barrier can be combined with any other class of barrier but only one maze can be built into one barrier.</li><br>
<li><b>Variable :</b> variable barriers can jack-up their defense in emergencies. If an attacker fails to break through the barrier, the barrier goes into overdrive, increasing the barriers defense by the indicated value during a number of rounds equal to the barrier level (see below) multiplied by the second indicated value. For example, a passive civilian Gamma barrier (4) equipped with a Stage 2 variable option will have its defense increased to +22 for 60 rounds or 3 minutes. One can voluntarily activate the increase, but it can only be done once per day.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Passive civilian barrier :</b> standard defense barriers everyone has or uses at some point. These are cheapest and most common. Thus, they are usually the easiest to break.</p>
<p><b>Barrier levels :</b> barriers come in levels : Alpha (1), Beta (2), Delta (3) and Gamma (4). Each more powerful and more expensive than the last. Other abilities and devices can raise Barrier Defense even more. There are equipments and hack actions that can increase that.</p>
<p><b>Boosters :</b> a booster is a barrier modification that increases the usefulness of ones TECH bonus to defense.</p>

<a id="i50"></a><h2>5. Netrun example</h2>
<p>Ice-9 hides behind a dumpster while his acolytes open fire across the driveway. She connects to the Net (wired plug on an access terminal) with her cyberbrain (CB : Speed +2, Interface bonus +2). She sees the Net around her and launches probes to see what is accessible.<br>
Her netrun initiative (25) gives her 6 actions. She feels great tonight and takes them all, for a -6 penality on each of her rolls.</p>

<h4>Action 1 : she scans the immediate surroundings to see what she can infiltrate</h4>
Int (9) + Locate (5) + non-specific Target (nothing) + 1D10 (6) + CB bonus (2) - multi actions (6) = 16 against Difficulty (15) = success.<br>
She sees that there is a camera in the north corner of the alley that might give her a good view of the security guards, and there is a Fenwick near the warehouse door. Finally, there is a network-connected terminal in the warehouse.

<h4>Action 2 : she tries to take control of the camera</h4>
Int (9) + Infiltrate (5) + Sensor (4) + 1D10 (8) + CB bonus (2) - multi actions (6) = 22 against Difficulty (20) = success.

<h4>Action 3 : she changes the orientation and zoom of the camera to see the warehouse door</h4>
Int (9) + Control (3) + Sensor (4) + 1D10 (5) + CB bonus (2) - multi actions (6) = 17 against Difficulty (10) = success.<br>
With the camera she sees that one of the guards is shooting using the back of the Fenwick as a shelter.

<h4>Action 4 : she tries to take control of the Fenwick</h4>
Int (9) + Infiltrate (5) + Vehicle (3) + 1D10 (3) + CB bonus (2) - multi actions (6) = 16 against Difficulty (20) = slight failure, can try again at +5.

<h4>Action 5 : the bullets fly around her, she grimaces and tries again</h4>
Int (9) + Infiltrate (5) + Vehicle (3) + 1D10 (3) + CC bonus (2) - multi actions (6) + 5 = 21 against Difficulty (20) = success.<br>
She smiles sardonically as the Fenwick control system materializes in her interface. More bullets are fired. She hears one of her colleagues grunt as a large-caliber bullet crashes into his bulletproof vest. There is movement on the other side of the dumpster, but she remains focused on the job.

<h4>Action 6 : she gains access to the Fenwick. She starts reversing at full speed</h4>
Int (9) + Control (3) + Vehicle (3) + 1D10 (5) + CB bonus (2) - multi actions (6) = 16 against Difficulty (10) = success.<br>
The tires squeal on the concrete as the Fenwick moves backwards, binding the guard's legs to the concrete.

<h4>NEXT ROUND</h4>
Ice-9's netrun initiative (18) gives her a maximum of 4 actions. She takes them all, for a -4 malus each. She discovers thanks to the camera another guard just a few meters behind, covering behind the corner of a wall.

<h4>Action 1 : she sends the Fenwick to the guard at full speed</h4>
Int (9) + Control (3) + Vehicle (3) + 1D10 (8) + CB bonus (2) - multi actions (4) = 21 against Difficulty (10) = 19 success.<br>
Unfortunately, the meatworld doesn't move as fast as the Net, and the Fenwick action will only be solved in the next round. Nevertheless, she knows that it's on his way and can concentrate elsewhere.

<h4>Action 2 : she tries to take control of the terminal she detected earlier</h4>
Int (9) + Infiltrate (4) + System (5) + 1D10 (8) + CB bonus (2) - multi actions (4) = 24 against Difficulty (20) = success.

<h4>Action 3 : she performs a basic diagnosis to see what this system can access</h4>
Int (9) + Information (2) + System (5) + 1D10 (5) + CB bonus (2) - multi actions (4) = 19 against Difficulty (10) = success.<br>
She discovers that this system has access to the warehouse security system.

<h4>Action 4 : she decides to open the main door of the warehouse</h4>
Int (9) + Control (3) + System (5) + 1D10 (4) + CB bonus (2) - multi actions (4) = 19 against Difficulty (20) = failure.<br>
As it is the end of the round and time is running out, Ice-9 decides to use one of her Luck points which gives her +1 on this roll. This gives her a total of 20, success !
<p>The scrolling door clicks and opens slowly. Shots are exchanged. Ice-9 unplugs and draws her Malorian. She hears a cry of agony and the heavy impact of a 2-ton Fenwick that flattens an individual against a wall, ending the shooting. The heavy door finishes opening.</p>
<p>Klick holsters his Minami submachine gun as Ice-9 emerges from behind the dumpster.<br>
&quot;Damn, you took your time ! Did you do your Christmas shopping or what ?&quot;, Ice-9 gives him a killer look &quot;Shut up and pick up the bodies, we've got a lot of work to do !&quot;</p>

<a id="i60"></a><h2>6. Cyberbrain and Ghost infiltration</h2>
<p>A new generation of netrunners has emerged since the emergence and widespread use of cyberbrains : Ghost hackers. It is indeed possible for a talented netrunner to infiltrate the cyberbrain of an individual with whom he has eye contact or whose coordinates he knows (see section 5). Cyberbrains usually have a good barrier and are therefore difficult to infiltrate, but it's worth the effort. Once penetrated, it is possible to do many things, such as change what the target sees and hears (to make you invisible to the target's eyes or to make visions appear), paralyze the person, play with their cyberwares, listen to their cybercomm conversations, etc.</p>
<p>All human cyberbrains (as opposed to the AI of an android or a robot, still...) contain a Ghost which is somehow the mind of the individual, his humanity. This area is even better guarded than the cyberbrain itself (best barrier) because a netrunner that will infiltrate it will be able to play with the memory and the recollections of the individual, even his personality. It is thus possible to steal, modify, erase memories and even modify the most vital functions of the individual.<br>
The heaviest penalties are incurred by those who infiltrate and modify a Ghost.</p>

<a id="i61"></a><h3>a. General rules</h3>
<p><b>System Knowledge/Interface :</b> these skills can receive bonuses/malus depending on the equipment used.<br><br><table><tr><td><b>Connection</b></td><td><b>Modifier</b></td></tr><tr><td>Through a Dummy Barrier*</td><td>-5</td></tr><tr><td>Wireless</td><td>-5</td></tr><tr><td>QRS Plug</td><td>+2 per additional QRS plug, up to a maximum of 4 plugs (maximum bonus of +6 therefore)</td></tr><tr><td>CyberHarness</td><td>+10</td></tr></table>* This is added to other bonuses. Staying behind a Dummy Barrier but diving via a CyberHarness offers a +5 bonus instead of +10 for example.</p>
<p><b>Back-hack :</b> to be wiretapped. Unlike the old days where sounds were overheard from a telephone line, here, flowing data is decrypted and read. Encryption has been introduced into even current wireless net connections, but it is easy to decipher a code that uses shared key encryption, and if you can go to a location where you can receive radio signals, it is fairly simple to intercept message content, even more so than with a wired link. In this era, even net environments that utilize satellites are widespread, and encryption ought to be suitably reinforced, but in the end, they and the people who are trying to crack it are caught in a vicious circle.<br>To monitor using cyberbrains or to re hack someone hacking it to find the source. Back-hacking can only occur if one is aware he is being hacked. If target is aware, they can attempt to hack back to either attack the target or find their location. Both must make Interface skills rolls. The highest wins. The winning attacking blocks the back hack. The winning defender can sever the connection (by going Autistic) or try to hack back and using the appropriate action (cracking their barriers and attacking). If two Hackers enter the same system, they can attempt to back-hack each other in an attempt to push the other out.</p>
<p><b>Additional QRS Plugs :</b> organic bodies only have 1 QRS socket. Most FBC have two. Few have more than 4. When hooking additional plugs, the hacker gains an additional +2 to all computer skills (Interface/System Knowledge). Additional plugs adds an additional +2 (no more than +6). The device being plugged into, however, must also have at least the same number of sockets and most do not have more than 4. More than 4 total sockets hooked up have no effect.
<p><img src="interface/GITS_InfoAge_11.jpg"></p>
<p><b>Teaming up :</b> brains are like computers. Linking another cyberbrain can assist in searches and hacks just by using his brains processing power. Anyone can team up on a system better than other. Each one that joins in using the same hack attack gives the primary hacker a +2 to all attempts to all rolls connected with that hack.</p>
<p><b>Total Cyberbrain Defense :</b> like in real combat, people can select to go full defensive, like increasing the paranoia of one's firewall. The character can elect to move any amount of his INT bonus (up to a maximum of half) to his Barrier Defenses (both of them). However, that character incurs that equally as a penalty to all Interface & System Knowledge rolls. This can be declared at the beginning of combat and can last as long as the character wishes. This is great for those non-hackers wanting extra protection instead of going into full Autistic mode. The character must declare going full defensive at the beginning of his attack.</p>
<p><b>Statistic Loss :</b> various attacks cause statistic loss, either temporary or permanently. Points lost to temporary damage return at the rate of 1 point per day (or double that if the character gets complete bed rest) to each damaged statistic. Permanent damage, however... is permanent.<br>- Intelligence at 0 means that the character cannot think and is unconscious in a coma-like stupor, helpless.<br>- Technical Ability at 0 means that the character is withdrawn into a deep sleep filled with nightmares, helpless.</p></p>
<p><b>Hacking Key :</b> a hacking key is a code access allowing someone to breach barriers. All military barriers have commander class hacking keys which allow authorized personal to break through to shut down cyberbrains if needed. Finding a hacking key allows one to circumvent all Surface barriers. Obviously, this is considered very important information. Many corporations own hacking keys to their personnel. Military commanders have keys to many of their troops. Having a key allows a hacker to circumvent the surface barriers and either go straight for the Ghost or start actions on the surface senses. If one has a key and attempts to ghost hack, they gain a +5 to their rolls for that cyberbrain. Entering Autistic mode will not prevent this breach as a key command overrides autistic mode.</p>
<p><b>Visual Camouflage :</b> there are two types of complete camouflage. The most effective concealment is the overriding of cyberbrain visual data, making someone see something that is not there or to remove someone or something totally from someone eye-sight. The process of overriding ones optical data and replacing visual information in real time is also known as &quot;stealing eyes&quot;. The process can make someone see something that is not there or not see something or someone in plain view. This was a known ability of the Laughing Man and is not an easy process. Hacking into one specific subject is one thing, hacking into anyone looking at the same target is another. An Omni directional virus would be the culprit then. This causes the same effects as being invisible.<p>The second type is full holographic virtual concealment. Although still not used widespread, its found some applications in covering large areas where hacking eyes would be considered too risky or impossible. The Tohoka Autonomous Region, for example, is covered by a huge holographic tarp. The TAR is built within a damn. The tarp covers the area in a lake, giving the illusion the dam is filled when it is not. Holographic Visual Camouflage cannot render something totally invisible but can block out objects with the appearance of others. It is also not effective against objects that are moving. However, it does create perfectly realistic looking terrain and can simulate several square kilometers of necessary. Obviously the power conceptions and the generator size make the concept of using it on anything other than large installations impractical. Tanks are the largest vehicles capable of using therm-optics effectively. Holographics are so real from a distance beyond 15 meters, there is not way to denounce its reality. Only within 15m, do viewers get a DC20 Awareness/Notice check to notice the illusion.</p>
<p><b>Autistic Mode :</b> cyberbrains are almost always connected to the Net. One never needs to use it, like working on ones personal computer while on high-speed internet. Even though it is constantly connected, until a browser is opened, you don't actually use the link. However, you can pull a cord from the modem. Cyberbrains are all connected via cellular and satellite. If one does not want to be open to the internet, they can activate Autistic mode. This cuts the connection to the internet, severing all communication in both directions. This is the most surefire way to prevent outside attack of ones cyberbrains (if one is paranoid enough). Autistic mode prevents any visual and aural communication and cuts off one's cyberbrain to any external memory sources. All cellular communication is cut. This action must be voluntary by the cyberbrain and cannot be forced by an external source (although implanted viruses can also accomplish this). Anyone diving is instantly severed <b>unless</b> that diver has safeguards against this and has in place preventative measures if the situation occurs (for example the diver creates an illusion that the user is in Autistic mode while, in fact, not). Viruses inside are still inside and may still function even while in Autistic mode. However, barring these rare exceptions, Autistic Mode is the surefire way to prevent outside attack.<p>While in Autistic Mode, the cyberbrain looses all its bonuses since it is no longer connected to the vast network of knowledge that is the Net. Activating Autistic takes a full round. Deactivating Autistic Mode, however, takes more time. A full 20 rounds (1 minute) is required to re-attach the connections. Until then, the cyberbrain is still in Autistic mode. This makes switching on and off from Autistic in combat unfeasible.<br>Even with Autistic mode on, direct linking via QRS plug will circumvent the severed link. Autistic mode only cuts off the cellular connection, not the QRS plug. Cyber blocker will cut both the cellular and the QRS plug. Someone in autistic mode can still hack into a target via direct link. However, if that target is connected to the net, a rival hacker can track into through the net and dive through the direct link as could the target that is being directly hacked.</p>
<p><b>Jamming Barrier :</b> jamming barriers are generators that can stretch from a single room to several blocks. This field blocks all cybercomms, radio, and non-direct plug hacking. Cyberbrains are totally disconnected unless going in via the plug. Viruses inside cyberbrains still operate.</p>
<p><b>Multiple Hackers :</b> it is very possible a hacker enters a cyberbrain or external memory or AI system and realize he or she is not alone. Another hacker is present. At that point, they may try to communicate but more than likely, one will try to push out the other. To do that, Netrun Initiative must take precedent on who can strike first. They may attempt to lock out the rival or even back-hack the hacker's cyberbrain.<br>Initiating a push out is the same as Back Hack, involving both hackers to roll Interface skill to try and force the other out. Back Hacking, if successful, does not stop either ones dive, but simply allows one to trace into the rival hacker's cyberbrain to infiltrate their cyberbrain (going through the Ghost). Here, the infiltrator knows they lost the Interface skill so can risk staying connected to keep diving in the original victim cyberbrain or pull out and sever the connection with the rival hacker and original victim.</p><p>Pushing Out does exactly that. It pushes the rival out of the original victim, forcing re-rolling to breach into the victim again. By that time, the winning hacker might have raised a wall to prevent the looser from trying to access again. Hack Actions on the original cyberbrain/AI/Server, do not pass onto the rival hacker. Physical damage can be initiated if the rival hacker uses the victim cyberbrain to power up a biofeedback attack (Temporary or Permanent Brain Damage).</p>
<p><b>Cyber ID :</b> once the surface barrier has been broken, the first piece of information relayed is the Cyberbrain ID. This also relays the IDs current location, allowing remote diving. This works with Back-hacked hackers as well. Cyberbrains IDs can be scrambled with the appropriate Hack Action. IDs are a serial number and company ID one can track to reveal one's name and even address. This is a fixed number hardwired in so unless the cyberbrain was purchase illegally, the Cyberbrain ID cannot be changed. However, secret government groups (Section 9 for example) have had their Cyberbrain IDs changed to the dummy company they are paid through and not Section 9.</p>
<p><b>Hacking into Death :</b> brain function continues into death for several minutes. This gives a hacker some opportunity for a quick dive in. Wireless links fail automatically. However, if the target had an INT of 2+ and was not killed by massive damage, a direct QRS plug can still access the cyberbrain. The barriers start failing immediately. Along with the standard bonus with the QRS plug, one diving into an unconscious targets gains a +5 to defeat surface and ghost barriers. If a target is dead, there is a single 10 rounds (30 seconds) window when actually death occurs to dive into a cyberbrain. After this short time, all ghost and surface barriers are nullified. However, there is little that can be accomplished at this point except for data retrieval, Target IDs, and such.</p>
<p><b>Time Adjustments :</b> after the first hour spent analyzing a barrier (just outside so a dive would be required), the hacker gains a +2 bonus to break that barrier. Every additional hour gains an additional +2 for up to 4 hours (total bonus of +8). This can only be made for that specific barrier and not for further barriers encountered. Also, this does not go towards hack actions rolls.</p>
<a id="i62"></a><h3>b. Ideas for possible actions and their associated difficulties</h3>
<p>Here is a list of typical actions with an idea of their difficulty (which can change depending on the target). To attempt these actions you will need to roll with your Command() + Target() skill as described in the first section of this document. This is by no means a complete list but rather an inspiration for netrunners.<br>
The full description of these actions can be found below in section 9.</p>
<h4>Type :</h4><ul><li><b>CyberHack :</b> CyberHacks are not viruses. They are direct actions one can commit on a target. CyberHacks are both offensive and defensive and can be used to strip down Barriers. For the entire duration of the effect, the portfolio slot is in constant use, so it cannot be used or swapped and the effect can not be used again while still in operation. CyberHacks cease functioning if the targets autistic mode is activated.</li><li><b>Ghost :</b> requires diving through the Ghost Barrier to work. Some are viruses while some are CyberHacks. Ones not listed as one or the other are permanent alterations.</li><li><b>Surface :</b> surface actions are not invasive and don't need to crack barriers to operate. They deactivate in autistic mode.</li><li><b>Virus :</b> a virus remains persistent even after the hacker has exfiltrated. Therefore the hacker does not need to maintain a link for the virus to continue its action. Viruses can have trigger mechanisms and be used in combination with others. This specific type of virus is not autonomous and the hacker has to place it correctly in the targeted system. It can stay there and be initialized as many times as desired. A virus will still operate even if the target actives autistic mode.</li><li><b>System :</b> applies to systems that do not have cyberbrains (servers, AI, computers, etc). The action is not necessarily intrusive and is sometimes just a simple request that does not affect the normal functioning of the target system.</li></ul>

</table><br>
<p><b>Note :</b> technically, one can self inflict their hack actions on themselves (ones that are not surface).<br>
Most temporary effects last 1D6 rounds (plus extra rounds depending on the success of the roll), except if the netrunner remains focused (can do nothing but defend himself).</p>

<a id="i63"></a><h3>c. Locate the target</h3>
<p>Searching for a target other than a cyberbrain whose location is unknown is done by scanning the Net :<br>
Library Search / 2 + Locate() + Target() + INT + 1D10 to find the target. The difficulty to beat depends on the type of system :</p>

<table>
<tr><td><b>Difficulty</b></td><td><b>Target example</b></td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Street-front public or corporate website</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Low-security target (school or SMB network)</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Personal computer connected to the Net (fixed station)</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>Corporate, police, government agency non-public networks</td></tr>
<tr><td>35+</td><td>Top-secret corporate and military servers and networks</td></tr>
</table>

<p>Locating a cyberbrain or mobile A.I. whose location and encryption key is unknown is another story. Attacking a cyberbrain requires either having visual contact with the person, or knowing the exact physical coordinates of the individual (via spy satellite, surveillance drones, an ally with a GPS or a cyberbrain having visual contact with the target, or even a surveillance camera whose coordinates are known).<br>
Sometimes the location of a target can be bought or exchanged with other netrunners or fixers (via Streetwise rolls, or via a contact/friend/special social capability). Most of these transactions take place in Virtual Cities.</p>

<a id="i64"></a><h3>d. Infiltrate the target</h3>
<p>Basically consists of passing the barriers undetected (often initialized from the outside, but also from the inside if the target has several layers of defense). This is always the case when infiltrating the Ghost of a cyberbrain, or for large compartmentalized systems.</p>
<p>Netrunner roll : Infiltrate() + Target() + INT + 1D10 + bonus/penalty</p>
<p>Difficulty to infiltrate/attack a system/network/IA other than a cyberbrain : Speed of the system + INT of the system (3 x CPU) + Protection (barrier value x 3) + 1D10<br>
Difficulty to infiltrate/attack a cyberbrain : cyberbrain barrier (depending on class and customization) + INT + 1D10<br>
Difficulty to infiltrate/attack a Ghost : cyberbrain barrier (depending on class and customization) + INT + 1D10 + 10</p>
<p><b>Success :</b> passes through the defenses undetected and can continue its infiltration. The netrunner can work for the number of rounds equal to the infiltration's margin of success before having to make a discretion roll.</p>
<p><b>Failure :</b> does not enter, and if the failure margin is greater than or equal to 5, the netrunner can also be detected by the system. This can lead to different responses : do nothing, eject the intruder, contact the sysop, contact the authorities (NetWatch or other private group), try to locate the netrunner (trace) to possibly counter-infiltrate or send troops, attack with a Black ICE to cause damage, cut the connection to the Net (autistic mode for cyberbrain).</p>
<p><b>Critical failure :</b> does not enter, is detected, and if the target has ICEs : automatic triggering of the fight (1 round minimum if it is outside).</p>

<a id="i65"></a><h3>e. Discretion</h3>
<p>Once the barrier(s) is/are past, making a discretion roll allows not to be detected during the intrusion. Every system has passive scanners that check the integrity of the cyberbrain at regular intervals.</p>
<p><b>Netrunner roll :</b> INT + Discretion() + Target() + 1D10 + bonus</p>
<p><b>Target equipped with a cyberbrain :</b> INT + Awareness/2 + Secure/Defend() + 1D10</p>
<p><b>Target not equipped with a cyberbrain :</b> Speed of the system + INT of the system (3 x CPU) + Protection (barrier value x 3) + 1D10 + Awareness/2 if applicable</p>
<p>The margin of success of the discretion roll gives the number of rounds before having to roll again.<br>
Note: some attacks will definitely reveal the presence of the netrunner.</p>

<a id="i66"></a><h3>f. Finding what you're looking for in the infiltrated system</h3>
<p><b>Roll :</b> Information() + Target () + INT + 1D10+ bonus/penalty</p>
Examples of difficulties according to the information you are looking for :
<table>
<tr><td><b>Difficulty</b></td><td><b>Type of file or target</b></td></tr>
<tr><td>10</td><td>Software</td></tr>
<tr><td>15</td><td>Common file</td></tr>
<tr><td>20</td><td>Public control system (locking of doors, drones, etc)</td></tr>
<tr><td>25</td><td>Precise data buried in the middle of others, secure control system</td></tr>
<tr><td>30</td><td>Hidden or protected data</td></tr>
<tr><td>35+</td><td>Top secret data, advanced control system</td></tr>
</table>

<a id="i70"></a><h2>7. Net combat</h2>
<p>Net combat can be very dangerous. The two opponents can try to fry their brains or stun each other by electric feedback, infiltrate the cyberbrain then the Ghost, eject themselves from the Net or physically locate themselves before sending troops...<br>
Net combat is like a real fight, round by round. It can take place anywhere in the matrix, but also inside a cyberbrain or a system.</p>
<p><b>Netrun initiative :</b> INT + Interface + Speed + 1D10 (2D10 and more for some cyberbrains)<br>
The netrunner generally has 2 actions for every 10 initiative points (0-10 : 2 actions, 11-20 : 4 actions, etc). If the netrunner is also distracted by the real world, the same maluses as at the beginning of the document apply.</p>
<p><b>System/Network/AI initiative</b> (not having a cyberbrain) : Speed of the system + INT of the system (3 x CPU) + 1D10/CPU + Interface if applicable.</p>
<p>For each action it is possible to attack (to do damage), infiltrate, log out (cut the connection) and trace (locate, does not require infiltration).</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Attack :</b><br>
Roll : INT + Attack() + Target() + Speed + 1D10 + bonus/penalty<br>
Defender with cyberbrain : INT + Secure/Defend() + Target() + Speed + 1D10 + bonus/penalty<br>
Consequence : if the defender loses, he takes 1D6 damage for every 5 margin points (+1D6 for each additional cable used by the defender). The attacker chooses whether the damage is real or semi-real. If the defender is wirelessly connected, they are necessarily semi-real.<br>
</li><br>
<li><b>Infiltrate :</b><br>
Difficulty to infiltrate/attack a system/network/IA other than a cyberbrain : Speed of the system + INT of the system (3 x CPU) + Protection (barrier value x 3) + 1D10<br>
Difficulty to infiltrate/attack a cyberbrain : cyberbrain barrier (depending on class and customization) + INT + 1D10<br>
Difficulty to infiltrate/attack a Ghost : cyberbrain barrier (depending on class and customization) + INT + 1D10 + 10<br>
Consequence : if the attacker wins he infiltrates the system/cyberbrain and can perform actions accordingly. The opponent can of course continue to attack for the duration of the infiltration.<br>
</li><br>
<li><b>Trace :</b><br>
Roll : INT + Locate() + Target() + Speed + 1D10 + bonus/penalty<br>
Defender with cyberbrain : INT + Discretion() + Target() + Speed + 1D10 + bonus/penalty<br>
Defender without cyberbrain : Speed of the system + INT of the system (3 x CPU) + 1D10 + Interface if applicable<br>
Consequence : if the attacker wins, he knows where the defender is physically located (GPS coordinates, elevations, etc) and how he is connected.
</li>
</ul>
At any time a combatant can choose to log out himself as a combat action.

<a id="i80"></a><h2>8. Glossary</h2>
<p><b>Agent Status :</b> AIs can't transmit their likeness nor can they attempt any diving without being given agent status.</p>
<p><b>Virtual City :</b> virtual cities resemble real cities. The virtual cities themselves grew from simple chat room boards but grew into massive population nerve centers of the artificial world. There are thousands of smaller cyber-communities but only a few are called virtual cities. These are populated by sometimes millions of people at a time. The largest is Virtual City Alpha. There is a Beta, Delta, and a Gamma as well. If one were to search for an interesting piece of information, checking the city would be the first place.</p>
<p><img src="interface/GITS_InfoAge_08.jpg"></p>
<p><b>Cyberbrain Closed Shell Syndrome :</b> someone who is overly-talented or too compatible with cyberbrain networking. Although it seems to refer to those unable to handle cyberbrain links, CCSS also refers to those who exhaustively try to stay connected. If they are on with a specific person, they'll even try brain diving in an attempt to share their consciousness, even if it means going up against attack barriers. Others with CCSS respond by locking themselves out with so many barriers, they can no longer communicate with the outside world. For therapy, patients must be isolate from the network and diving is regulated and monitored. Government agencies have employed CCSS cases to use their unique autistic talents for a benefit. CCSS cases that always want to stay connected usually display an astonishing knack for cyberspace. Agencies have employed their skills to create some of the most complicated maze barriers known to the Net. However, these cases must be monitored as those assigned these tasks would work tirelessly, never sleeping or eating, constantly working without stopping.</p>
<p><b>Ibogaine :</b> Ibogaine is a psychedelic substance derived from the roots of the iboga plant in Central West Africa. It found use as a minor drug-maze inducer in e-brain warfare. Later, more effective drug mazes would be developed but Ibogaine is somewhat easy to get a hold of. It offers a +3 to Barrier Defense and an additional +2 to Maze Ranks for 4D6 rounds. However, it saps one awareness of the outside world. For that same duration, it causes a -2 malus to all rolls outside the Net because it takes consciousness away from the real world.</p>
<p><b>Ghost Dubbing :</b> Ghost dubbing is not a viable way of gaining immortality. The process is illegal, the end result, disturbing. The process includes a very invasive scan of the brain, right down to ever solitary synapse. The information is then copied and burned into a new cyberbrain. The process is so volatile, that the original Ghost often dies. This process is obviously illegal. Everytime a Ghost is dubbed, both the original and the copy lose part of their humanity (3D6). Every time an original ghost is copied, it loses 2D4 skill points based on INT. Obviously one cannot be copied more than three or four times before totally braindeath. The new copy is identical, but also suffers from the 2D4 loss. Dubbed Ghosts cannot be dubbed themselves... attempting it causes them to lose 3D4 during the process. The mechanism for dubbing is large and has no official cost but rumors speak of an astronomical cost.</p>
<p><img src="interface/GITS_InfoAge_10.jpg"></p>
<p><b>Go Wired :</b> to directly link with a cyberbrain or terminal without through the net using a QRS plug.</p>
<p><b>Satellites :</b> some hack actions require linking with a satellite. Many satellites have attack barriers to prevent someone from trying to hijack the system completely. However, the hack actions that use satellites are not really taking control, more like the action is using a satellites overhead to utilize its primary functions. Attempting to hijack a specific satellite (like a military spy satellite that transmits Hawkeye data) does require hacking that satellite specifically, requiring diving and barrier penetration.</p>
<p><b>Intergate :</b> gates into locked data storage.</p>
<p><img src="interface/GITS_InfoAge_04.jpg"></p>
<p><b>Terminal :</b> terminals are not independent computers but simply access ports where one can access the Net. Terminals are everywhere. Few people have personal computers anymore. Mostly, they just own terminals and external memories.</p>
<p><b>Visual Communications :</b> cyberbrain communications can either be radio or generate image of the person with a scroll of their name behind. It is not really them but a generated video of their likeness. As a result, it can be altered.</p>

<a id="i90"></a><h2>9. Hack actions</h2>
<h3 class="c"><a id="hack1">Alarm</a></h3>
	<b>Type :</b> Surface<br>
	<b>Difficulty :</b> 15<br>
	<b>Time :</b> 1 action<br>
	<b>Duration :</b> 2 hours / Interface skill level<br>
	<b>Effects :</b> cyberbrains / servers / AI<br>
	An alarm alerts you (and only you) to something it is programmed to detect on a visual or audio device. This is either a specific voice, a word or if a face crosses into a camera. There is a 50% chance that the sensor will not pick up a face however. You note a single mental &quot;ping&quot; that awakens you from normal sleep but does not otherwise disturb concentration. This action works on servers with visual devices or cyberbrains.
<h3 class="c"><a id="hack2">Alert Barrier</a></h3>
	<b>Type :</b> Surface<br>
	<b>Difficulty :</b> 30<br>
	<b>Time :</b> 1 action<br>
	<b>Duration :</b> 1 round / Interface skill level<br>
	<b>Effects :</b> personal<br>
	Your gains a +5 to all barrier levels.
<h3 class="c"><a id="hack3">Backdoor</a></h3>
	<b>Type :</b> Ghost / Virus<br>
	<b>Difficulty :</b> 40<br>
	<b>Time :</b> 1 action<br>
	<b>Duration :</b> 1 jour / Interface skill level<br>
	<b>Effects :</b> cyberbrains<br>
	You create a hole in the back of someone's cyberbrain. It allows access even if the target activates autistic mode. It accomplishes this by simulating autistic mode while not really being in it. You still have to crack one's barriers but now, the target cannot escape in autistic mode.
<h3 class="c"><a id="hack4">Bane</a></h3>
	<b>Type :</b> CyberHack<br>
	<b>Difficulty :</b> 20<br>
	<b>Time :</b> 1 action<br>
	<b>Duration :</b> 1 min / Interface skill level<br>
	<b>Effects :</b> cyberbrains<br>
	Bane fills your enemies with fear and doubt. She receives a -2 penalty on attack and COOL rolls.
<h3 class="c"><a id="hack5">Binding</a></h3>
	<b>Type :</b> CyberHack<br>
	<b>Difficulty :</b> 25<br>
	<b>Time :</b> 1 action<br>
	<b>Duration :</b> 1 round / Interface skill level<br>
	<b>Effects :</b> cyberbrains / servers / AI<br>
	This hack paralyzes a target. Brut strenght won't help since it's a shutdown of the motor system of the body ordered by the cyberbrain. You must stay logged in for the duration of the binding to prevent the system from rebooting. After this time, the cyberbrain will be able to regain control.
<h3 class="c"><a id="hack6">Blur</a></h3>
	<b>Type :</b> CyberHack<br>
	<b>Difficulty :</b> 15<br>
	<b>Time :</b> 1 action<br>
	<b>Duration :</b> 1 min / Interface skill level<br>
	<b>Effects :</b> cyberbrains / servers / AI<br>
	The hacker denotes one target in the subject's view. Their outline appears blurred, shifting and wavering. This distortion allows the hacker to partially camouflage himself and results in a -2 penalty to the target's attack rolls against him.
<h3 class="c"><a id="hack8">Change Self</a></h3>
	<b>Type :</b> Surface<br>
	<b>Difficulty :</b> 10<br>
	<b>Time :</b> 1 action<br>
	<b>Duration :</b> permanent<br>
	<b>Effects :</b> personal<br>
	You change your appearance online. This alters the image of yourself while suffering and during visual communication. It changes the image from the source, and does not invade another brain to do it. This is only good for the Net and not in real life. The effect is permanent until switched or turned off.
<h3 class="c"><a id="hack7">Charm</a></h3>
	<b>Type :</b> Virus<br>
	<b>Difficulty :</b> 25<br>

	<b>Duration :</b> 1 hour / Interface skill level<br>
	<b>Effects :</b> cyberbrains / servers / AI<br>
	This charm makes a cyberbrain regard you as its trusted friend and ally (treat the target's attitude as friendly). If the creature is currently being threatened or attacked by you or your allies, however, it will resist the effects.<br>The effect does not enable you to control the charmed person as if it were an automaton, but it perceives your words and actions in the most favorable way. You can try to give the subject orders, but you must make a successful Persuasion & Fast Talk roll against a Human Perception roll of the target to convince it to do anything it wouldn't ordinarily do (retries are not allowed). An affected subject never obeys suicidal or obviously harmful orders, but it might be convinced that something very dangerous is worth doing. Any act by you or your apparent allies that threatens the charmed person breaks the effect. You must speak the person's language to communicate your commands.

	<b>Duration :</b> 1 round<br>
	<b>Effects :</b> cyberbrains / servers / AI<br>
	You give the subject a single command, which it obeys to the best of its ability at its earliest opportunity. You may select from the following options :<br><i>Approach</i> : on its turn, the subject moves toward you as quickly and directly as possible for 1 round. The target may do nothing but move during its turn.<br><i>Drop</i> : on its turn, the subject drops whatever it is holding. It can't pick up any dropped item until its next turn.<br><i>Fall</i> : on its turn, the subject falls to the ground and remains prone for 1 round. It may act normally while prone but takes any appropriate penalties.<br><i>Flee</i> : on its turn, the subject moves away from you as quickly as possible for 1 round. It may do nothing but move during its turn.<br><i>Halt</i> : the subject stands in place for 1 round. It may not take any actions but is not considered helpless. If the subject can't carry out your command on its next turn, the effect fails.<br>If assaulting a cyberbrain with a ghost, the ghost barrier must be penetrated as well.

	<b>Time :</b> 1 action<br>
	<b>Duration :</b> 1 round / Interface skill level<br>
	<b>Effects :</b> cyberbrains / servers / AI<br>
	This causes the targets to become confused, making them unable to independently determine what they will do. Roll on the following table at the beginning of each subject's turn each round to see what the subject does in that round.<table><tr><td><b>D10</b></td><td><b>Behavior</b></td></tr><tr><td>1-2</td><td>Act normally</td></tr><tr><td>3-5</td><td>Do nothing but babble incoherently</td></tr><tr><td>6-7</td><td>Flee away at top possible speed</td></tr><tr><td>8-10</td><td>Attack nearest creature</td></tr></table>A confused character who can't carry out the indicated action does nothing but babble incoherently. Attackers are not at any special advantage when attacking a confused character. Any confused character who is attacked automatically attacks its attackers on its next turn, even if he's still confused.
<h3 class="c"><a id="hack11">Cyberbrain Message</a></h3>
	<b>Type :</b> Virus<br>
	<b>Difficulty :</b> 15<br>
	<b>Time :</b> 1 round full<br>
	<b>Duration :</b> permanent<br>
	<b>Effects :</b> all<br>
	<b>Target :</b> 1 person or terminal / Interface skill level<br>This hack that implants a subtle program that sends out a message that's delivered when a specified event occurs. The message, preferably short, is delivered in a non-evasive manner into the subject visual cortex or in a manner appropriate to the device targeted by the hack. An electronic traffic sign displays the message for all motorists to see for example.<br>The virus functions when specific conditions are fulfilled according to your command as set in the virus. Commands can be as general or specific as desired, although only visual and audible triggers can be used such as the following : &quot;deliver the message when a man in a dark suit walks past with a gun drawn&quot;. Triggers react to what appears to be the case. Audible triggers can be keyed to general types of noises (footsteps, elevator music) or to a specific noise or a spoken work. Actions can serve as triggers if they are visible or audible. For example : &quot;deliver the message when any creature picks up the talking doll&quot; is an acceptable command if the creature is visible. The object, however, has to be able to detect such a occurrence.

	<b>Duration :</b> 1 min / Interface skill level<br>
	<b>Effects :</b> cyberbrains / servers / AI<br>
	<b>Range :</b> 30 meters / Interface skill level<br>You hack into someone cyberbrain but do not take control. You simply sit over-top of the brain and copy all visual and audio input to your cyberbrain. You can see and hear everything the target is encountering but don't encounter any physical input. You take no damage if they take it. If killed, the monitor encounters nothing... the feed is simply cut. If problems or abilities of the eyes and ears are carried as well. If a subject is colorblind, the monitor will transmit that. If the eyes are enhanced to see in darkness, that is transmitted as well. If the cyberbrain was already hacked to see something else, that to is ALSO carried over. You also overhear non-encrypted cybercomms.

	<b>Time :</b> 1 action<br>
	<b>Duration :</b> 1 round<br>
	<b>Effects :</b> cyberbrains / servers / AI<br>
	This is virus like cyberbrain message except instead of instantly trying to force instructions, the virus remains after being deposited and waits for an external input (visual or aural) and triggers the command which the subject does its best to carry out. This command must be clear and concise, and in the language of the target. If assaulting a cyberbrain with a ghost, the ghost barrier must be penetrated as well.
<h3 class="c"><a id="hack19">Detect Cyberbrain Invasion</a></h3>

	You make yourself (including clothing, armor, weapons, and equipment) look different. You can seem 30 cm shorter or taller, thin, fat or in between. You cannot change your body type. Otherwise, the extent of the apparent change is up to you. You could add or obscure a minor feature or look like an entirely different person. You get a +10 bonus on the Disguise checks to that subject.

<h3 class="c"><a id="hack24">Dominate Person</a></h3>
	<b>Type :</b> CyberHack / Ghost / Virus<br>
	<b>Difficulty :</b> 30<br>
	<b>Time :</b> 1 round full<br>
	<b>Duration :</b> 1 min / Interface skill level<br>
	<b>Effects :</b> cyberbrains / servers / AI<br>
	You can control the actions the target through a link that you establish with the cyberbrain. You can generally force the subject to perform as you desire, within the limits of its abilities. You know what the subject is experiencing, but you do not receive direct sensory input from it. Once you have given a dominated subject a command, it continues to attempt to carry out that command to the exclusion of all other activities except those necessary for day-to-day survival (such as sleeping, eating, and so forth). Because of this limited range of activity, a Awareness/Notice check against DC 15 can determine that the subject's behavior is being influenced by the effect. Changing your instructions or giving a dominated subject a new command is a new action.<br>By concentrating fully on the subject, you can receive full sensory input as interpreted by the mind of the subject, though it still can't communicate with you. Obviously self-destructive orders are not carried out. Once control is established, the range at which it can be exercised is unlimited. You need not see the subject to control it (even though you needed to know exactly where it was to attack its barrier). If assaulting a Ghost inhabited cyberbrain, then the Ghost barrier must be breached to seize control.
<h3 class="c"><a id="hack25">Electromagnetic Pulse</a></h3>

	<b>Difficulty :</b> 25<br>
	<b>Time :</b> 2 actions<br>
	<b>Duration :</b> aucune<br>
	<b>Effects :</b> external memories / servers / AI<br>
	You create a power surge in the device that ruins electronic circuitry within. Any computer, telephone, television or other device with a computer processor inside ceases to function immediately, and the contents of external memory and other storage media connected are scrambled. The pulse affects only devices with circuitry connected to the power source, not everything that uses electricity. Ordinarily the lights stay on, although their electronic switches might not function. Automobiles shut down if they can be hacked in externally.<br><br><table><tr><td><b>Repair task (example)</b></td><td><b>Relevant skill</b></td><td><b>Difficulty</b></td><td><b>Cost</b></td><td><b>Time</b></td></tr><tr><td>Simple processors (cars, elevator controls)</td><td>Electronics</td><td>20</td><td>500 eb</td><td>10 min.</td></tr><tr><td>Complex processors (computers, home theaters)</td><td>Electronics</td><td>25</td><td>2000 eb</td><td>1 hr.</td></tr><tr><td>Data recovery (scrambled hard drive)</td><td>Interface</td><td>30</td><td>9000 eb</td><td>2 hr.</td></tr></table><br>You can jury-rig repairs more quickly and cheaply, but the repairs may not last.

	<b>Duration :</b> 1 min / Interface skill level<br>
	<b>Effects :</b> cyberbrains / servers / AI<br>
	<b>Special :</b> two targets must roll.<br>You and another target decide to go on encryption. Both you and the target must then beat the DC and then they can carry on a private communication that cannot be overheard. Not even infiltrating cybercomms will pick this up. Usually, anyone can have a private conversation via cybercomms but someone may have initiated an Infiltrate Cybercomm action. If one is not worried about a certain individual overhearing, they can talk one on one without using this action.
<h3 class="c"><a id="hack29">Erase Memory</a></h3>
	<b>Type :</b> Ghost<br>
	<b>Difficulty :</b> 35<br>
	<b>Time :</b> 1 action<br>
	<b>Duration :</b> permanent<br>
	<b>Effects :</b> cyberbrains / servers / AI<br>
	Erase removes a specific memory from the cyberbrain. The memory cannot be more than a day but any lesser time is allowed. It also must be at the most, 5 years old. There is no other adverse effects to skills or Intelligence... the memory has simply been erased. In addition to humans, only AIs with a Ghost are affected.
<h3 class="c"><a id="hack30">False Vision</a></h3>
	<b>Type :</b> Surface / Virus<br>
	<b>Difficulty :</b> 15<br>
	<b>Time :</b> 1 action<br>
	<b>Duration :</b> 1 hour / Interface skill level<br>
	<b>Effects :</b> cyberbrains / servers / AI<br>
	The action creates a static image in a certain location. This can be as small as a weapon or as large as a building. The moment the target interferes with it, however, the illusion has been revealed and the virus is kicked out. The image remains static. The image must be able to fit there. If it doesn't seem to fit (like a car floating in mid air, a building too small for anyone to fit), then the illusion is shattered but the target can maintain the illusion of it does not interfere where their lives. If the illusion is not intentional jarring without any invasive effect, then it can be a surface action, not requiring a barrier penetration.
<h3 class="c"><a id="hack31">Fear</a></h3>
	<b>Type :</b> Ghost<br>
	<b>Difficulty :</b> 25<br>
	<b>Time :</b> 1 action<br>
	<b>Duration :</b> 1 round / Interface skill level<br>
	<b>Effects :</b> cyberbrains<br>
	The target is panic-stricken and will try to flee as far away as possible from a real or fictitious danger (towards home for example). If cornered, he will first crouch down before begging potential enemies to spare him (even if they are his own allies).
<h3 class="c"><a id="hack32">Feeble Mind</a></h3>
	<b>Type :</b> Ghost<br>
	<b>Difficulty :</b> 35<br>
	<b>Time :</b> 1 action<br>
	<b>Duration :</b> 1 hour / Interface skill level<br>
	<b>Effects :</b> cyberbrains<br>
	The target Intelligence, Empathy and Technical Ability scores each drop to 1. The affected target is unable to use skills based on these statistics, understand language or communicate coherently. The cyberbrain effectively turns off its own higher brain functions.
<h3 class="c"><a id="hack33">Find the Path</a></h3>
	<b>Type :</b> System<br>
	<b>Difficulty :</b> 10<br>
	<b>Time :</b> 3 rounds<br>
	<b>Duration :</b> 10 min / Interface skill level<br>
	<b>Effects :</b> personal<br>
	You can access an overhead satellite. This one relays the map of the area. It shows all the street with names and all the buildings. This action can find the shortest, most direct physical route to a specified destination, be it the way into or out of a locale. Find the path works with respect to locations, not objects or creatures at a locale.
<h3 class="c"><a id="hack34">Floating Image</a></h3>
	<b>Type :</b> Virus<br>
	<b>Difficulty :</b> 25<br>
	<b>Time :</b> 1 action<br>
	<b>Duration :</b> 10 min / Interface skill level<br>
	<b>Effects :</b> all<br>
	Like False Vision except this creates an image that can track with an object or move on given commands when the action is initiated. The image can be anything and will not disrupt if unrealistic, unlike False Vision. It stays there if proven real or not.
<h3 class="c"><a id="hack35">Forced Transfer</a></h3>
	<b>Type :</b> CyberHack<br>
	<b>Difficulty :</b> 30<br>
	<b>Time :</b> 1 action<br>
	<b>Duration :</b> 1 round / Interface skill level<br>
	<b>Effects :</b> cyberbrains / servers / AI<br>
	The cyberhack forces another to move to their location. If they are in a virtual area or a server or another cyberbrain, they are forced to the attacker's cyberbrain or a virtual environment of their choosing or creation. This stops their attack if they were attacking another target. If the target is drawn into the cyberbrain, they cannot hack the transfer initiator without going through the normal barrier procedures.
<h3 class="c"><a id="hack36">Ghost Sound</a></h3>
	<b>Type :</b> CyberHack<br>
	<b>Difficulty :</b> 20<br>
	<b>Time :</b> 1 action<br>
	<b>Duration :</b> 1 round / Interface skill level<br>
	<b>Effects :</b> cyberbrains / servers / AI<br>
	Ghost sound allows you to create a volume of sound that rises, recedes, approaches or remains at a fixed place. You choose what type of sound ghost sound creates when committed the action and cannot thereafter change the sound's basic character.<br>The volume of sound created depends on your level. You can produce as much noise as four normal humans per Interface skill level (maximum twenty humans). Thus, talking, singing, shouting, walking, marching or running sounds can be created. The noise a ghost sound produces can be virtually any type of sound within the volume limit. A horde of rats running and squeaking is about the same volume as eight humans running and shouting. A roaring lion is equal to the noise from sixteen humans, while a roaring dire tiger is equal to the noise from twenty humans.
<h3 class="c"><a id="hack37">Hack Boost</a></h3>

	<b>Type :</b> Ghost<br>
	<b>Difficulty :</b> 25<br>
	<b>Time :</b> 1 action<br>
	<b>Duration :</b> 1 round / Interface skill level<br>
	<b>Effects :</b> cyberbrains<br>
	This afflicts the subject with uncontrollable laughter. It collapses into gales of manic laughter, falling prone. The subject can take no actions while laughing, but is not considered helpless. After the effect ends, it can act normally.
<h3 class="c"><a id="hack39">Hijack Electronics</a></h3>
	<b>Type :</b> System<br>
	<b>Difficulty :</b> 20<br>
	<b>Time :</b> 1 action<br>
	<b>Duration :</b> 1 min / Interface skill level<br>
	<b>Effects :</b> servers / AI<br>
	You take control of electronics hooked into that terminal or server or AI. This includes machinery, gun emplacements and cameras. You cannot make them do something they are incapable of doing. For example, with cameras you see what they see and can move the camera but you cannot short them out, turn them off or override their visual input.
<h3 class="c"><a id="hack40">Hold</a></h3>
	<b>Type :</b> Virus<br>
	<b>Difficulty :</b> 35<br>
	<b>Time :</b> 1 action<br>
	<b>Duration :</b> 1D6 rounds + 1 round / Interface skill level<br>
	<b>Effects :</b> cyberbrains / servers / AI<br>
	This virus heavily affects the motor system of the target's body, causing it to fall down and leave it inert on the ground while the cyberbrain reboots the entire system and makes the necessary repairs. The target remains conscious even if it is unable to move a single limb (which includes its tongue).
<h3 class="c"><a id="hack41">Infiltrate Cybercomms</a></h3>
	<b>Type :</b> CyberHack<br>
	<b>Difficulty :</b> 20<br>
	<b>Time :</b> 1 action<br>
	<b>Duration :</b> 1 min / Interface skill level<br>
	<b>Effects :</b> cyberbrains / servers / AI<br>
	You never dive too deep, but simply monitor outgoing communication from the cyberbrain. This is better than tapping into transmission (by monitoring the frequency) as they are often scrambled. You hear all incoming and outgoing communication that cyberbrain, AI or server. The only communication it cannot overhear is Encrypted Cybercomms.
<h3 class="c"><a id="hack42">Invisibility</a></h3>
	<b>Type :</b> CyberHack<br>
	<b>Difficulty :</b> 30<br>
	<b>Time :</b> 1 action<br>
	<b>Duration :</b> 1 min / Interface skill level<br>
	<b>Effects :</b> cyberbrains / servers / AI<br>
	You erase yourself from the target's optical input, vanishing from sight, even from darkvision. If you are carrying gear, that vanishes, too. Unlike thermoptics, you completely vanish. Items dropped or put down while invisible become visible; items picked up disappear if tucked into the clothing or pouches worn.<br>Of course, the subject is not silenced, and certain other conditions can render the recipient detectable (such as stepping in a puddle). The effect ends if you attack any creature. Causing harm indirectly is not an attack. Thus, an invisible being can open doors, talk, eat, climb stairs, cut the ropes holding a rope bridge while enemies are on the bridge, remotely trigger traps, open a door to release attack dogs, and so forth. If you attack directly, however, you immediately becomes visible along with all your gear.

	<b>Time :</b> 1 action<br>
	<b>Duration :</b> 1 round / Interface skill level<br>
	<b>Effects :</b> all<br>
	While diving inside a system, regardless of its type, you throw a wall behind you preventing others from diving in as well. For as long as the action lasts or until you leave or are kicked out of the location, no one else but you can access that system. This prevents rivals from trying to compete and or force you out or initiate an attack on you from inside the target.
<h3 class="c"><a id="hack45">Memory Fabrication</a></h3>

	<b>Effects :</b> cyberbrains<br>
	You can totally fabricate a reality for a target in real-time. You must keep concentrating and breaking that concentration break that reality. The fabrication feels totally real and even breaking the laws of reality may not dislodge to target from the illusion. You can create a solid memory without disbelief and it would be totally real forever. Little can be done to restore that memory. If the reality is meant to cause harm, it can do one of the following :<ul><li>Create a destabilizing reality meant to break one's will and grasp on normality. The world starts breaking down. This could be a sequence of repeating events that make so sense or a series of events that cannot occur in reality. The subject looses 1D4 INT after an hour in the reality. After this period, it can escape if it makes an INT roll of +2 greater than or equal to half your hack roll. This continues until the target cracks out or is reduced to a comatosed stupor.</li><li>Create a horrific nightmare the subject cannot break out of. The world turns into the a Lovecraft story of insanity and fear. The subject looses 1D4 COOL after an hour in the reality. After this period, it can escape if it makes an COOL roll of +2 greater than or equal to half your hack roll. This continues until the target cracks out or withdraws into a deep sleep filled with nightmares, helpless.</li></ul>

	<b>Effects :</b> cyberbrains / external memories / servers / AI<br>
	You alter one memory in a minor way. The memory can be anywhere in brain, any location in the external memory, or any memory in one's timeline. The memory is not deleted or radically altered. Only one aspect is slightly modified. A door can be closed when open. Someone can turn left instead of right. If someone sees and remembers a map, said map may be altered to look different (removing a hatch, adding bars, etc). Someone's appearance can be altered. A street sign renamed. The effect must be minor enough for to not convey suspicion that one's memory has been altered in that way.

	<b>Type :</b> Ghost<br>
	<b>Difficulty :</b> 30<br>
	<b>Time :</b> 1 hour<br>
	<b>Duration :</b> permanent<br>
	<b>Effects :</b> cyberbrains<br>
	You reach into the subject's mind and modify as many as 5 minutes of its memories in one of the following ways :<br>- Eliminate all memory of an event the subject actually experienced.<br>- Change the details of an event the subject actually experienced.<br>- Implant a memory of an event the subject never experienced.<br>A modified memory does not necessarily affect the subject's actions, particularly if it contradicts the their natural inclinations.
<h3 class="c"><a id="hack51">Monitor</a></h3>
	<b>Type :</b> CyberHack<br>
	<b>Difficulty :</b> 20<br>
	<b>Time :</b> 1 action<br>
	<b>Duration :</b> 1 min / Interface skill level<br>
	<b>Effects :</b> cyberbrains / servers / AI<br>
	You don't interfere with the cyberbrain, you simply access their visual and audio sensors. You see and hear what they hear, but don't interfere. If the target's eyes have been hacked themselves, the monitor sees the altered sense as well.
<h3 class="c"><a id="hack28">Permanent Brain Damage</a></h3>
	<b>Type :</b> CyberHack<br>
	<b>Difficulty :</b> 40<br>
	<b>Time :</b> 2 actions<br>
	<b>Duration :</b> aucune<br>
	<b>Effects :</b> cyberbrains / servers / AI<br>
	The targeted brain suffers 1D4 damage to Intelligence permanently. Only with the help of complex surgical operations and intensive care can it be fully recovered. A regenerator can also be useful, but its use is dangerous. If no care is given the target loses 1D10 skill points per INT point.<br>There must be a physical connection to instigate the surge, wireless attacks cannot cause energy damage. It does not require breaking through the barrier but each barrier not broken absorbs one point of damage.
<h3 class="c"><a id="hack52">Relay Text</a></h3>
	<b>Type :</b> CyberHack<br>
	<b>Difficulty :</b> 10<br>
	<b>Time :</b> 1 action<br>
	<b>Duration :</b> immediate<br>
	<b>Effects :</b> external memories / servers / AI<br>
	You cause a short text message to appear on the screen of an electronic device capable of receiving such messages, such as a cell phone, pager, PDA or computer. If the device is turned on, the message appears instantly; if not, the message appears as soon as someone turns it on. The message remains onscreen until read, then disappears, leaving no electronic record of its appearance. You must be aware of the device and its location to send a message to it.
<h3 class="c"><a id="hack53">Satellite Detection</a></h3>
	<b>Type :</b> System / Virus<br>
	<b>Difficulty :</b> 30<br>
	<b>Time :</b> 1 action<br>
	<b>Duration :</b> 10 min / Interface skill level<br>
	<b>Effects :</b> personal<br>
	You uplink to a satellite overhead, giving you the birds eye view of what's around you. You must be outside to do that and the effect nullifies if in a building. It shows everything 25 meters in every direction from the hacker. The satellite has no special eyes for darkness or x-ray. While the action is in effect, the hacker cannot be caught flat footed or surprised unless a target has thermoptic camo or strikes from a range beyond the scope of the sensor.
<h3 class="c"><a id="hack54">Security Wipe</a></h3>
	<b>Type :</b> System / Virus<br>
	<b>Difficulty :</b> 30<br>
	<b>Time :</b> 2 actions<br>
	<b>Duration :</b> aucune<br>
	<b>Effects :</b> servers / AI<br>
	You can suppresses all mechanical or electronic intrusion alarms and alarm sensors in the affected area : one room, +5/DC per additional room or roll separately. Burglar alarms or other intrusion alarms within the affected area simply fail to function; sensors for intrusion alarm systems (such as motion detectors, IR detectors, pressure sensors, electronic eyes, and so forth) also fail to function, sending no signal to monitoring stations. Video surveillance devices continue to send whatever image they were photographing the moment when the action was committed.
<h3 class="c"><a id="hack55">Silence</a></h3>
	<b>Type :</b> CyberHack<br>
	<b>Difficulty :</b> 25<br>
	<b>Time :</b> 1 action<br>
	<b>Duration :</b> 1 min / Interface skill level<br>
	<b>Effects :</b> cyberbrains / servers / AI<br>
	Upon initiating this action, the target cannot hear a specific sound or is deaf. All sound can be stopped. The Stealth skill gains a +20 bonus against this target.
<h3 class="c"><a id="hack56">Sleep</a></h3>
	<b>Type :</b> CyberHack<br>
	<b>Difficulty :</b> 30<br>
	<b>Time :</b> 1 round full<br>
	<b>Duration :</b> 1 min / Interface skill level<br>
	<b>Effects :</b> cyberbrains<br>
	<b>Range :</b> 30 meters + 3 meters / level<br>Sleep causes a target to pass out. Sleeping targets are helpless. Slapping or wounding awakens an affected target, but normal noise does not. Awakening a target takes an action.
<h3 class="c"><a id="hack57">Slow</a></h3>
	<b>Type :</b> Virus<br>
	<b>Difficulty :</b> 20<br>
	<b>Time :</b> 1 action<br>
	<b>Duration :</b> 1 round / Interface skill level<br>
	<b>Effects :</b> cyberbrains / servers / AI<br>
	An affected target moves and attacks at a drastically slowed rate. A slowed target can only use one action each turn and suffers a penalty of -3 on its attack, defense and Reflexes rolls. A slowed target moves at half its normal speed, which reduces the target's jumping distance.
<h3 class="c"><a id="hack58">Speech Jack</a></h3>
	<b>Type :</b> CyberHack / Ghost<br>
	<b>Difficulty :</b> 25<br>
	<b>Time :</b> 1 action<br>
	<b>Duration :</b> 1 round / Interface skill level<br>
	<b>Effects :</b> cyberbrains / servers / AI<br>
	You hijack ones vocal system, getting them to say what you want them to say. They say it without resistance and with any emotional inflection you wish convey. You also implant a minor bug that makes the speaker want to say it while he or she is saying it (if infiltrating a ghost cyberbrain). Therefore, the subject cannot stop themselves physically from saying it nor can they give physical clues that are being influenced. Only after the action wears off can one attempt to repair any damage caused by what was said.
<h3 class="c"><a id="hack59">Steal/Delete Program/Information</a></h3>
	<b>Type :</b> CyberHack<br>
	<b>Difficulty :</b> 20<br>
	<b>Time :</b> 2 actions<br>
	<b>Duration :</b> immediate<br>
	<b>Effects :</b> cyberbrains / servers / AI<br>
	You remove or delete an operating surface action in the target. First, the target must reveal all surface actions or programs currently running. Any benefits of the program are lost if it is deleted. Copying the program is only useful if the hack action contains useful information. You now have access to satellite uplinks (if running), target IDs, relay text or even the encryption for cybercomms.<br>If the item being stolen or deleted is not a hack action, it may be a downloaded piece of information and not a memory of the subject. This includes maps or files in memory. This latter function is obviously more useful with Server and AIs.<br>If you want to use this hack again on the target, it will only cost you one action, but your list may not be up to date.
<h3 class="c"><a id="hack60">Target Arrow</a></h3>
	<b>Type :</b> Surface<br>
	<b>Difficulty :</b> 15<br>
	<b>Time :</b> 1 action<br>
	<b>Duration :</b> 1 min / Interface skill level<br>
	<b>Effects :</b> personal<br>
	An aura surrounds and outlines the targets. Outlined subjects can be tracked and do not benefit from the concealment normally provided by darkness, blur, displacement, invisibility or similar effects. This effect only benefits the hacker.
<h3 class="c"><a id="hack61">Target Arrow, Mass</a></h3>
	<b>Type :</b> Surface<br>
	<b>Difficulty :</b> 20<br>
	<b>Time :</b> 1 action<br>
	<b>Duration :</b> 1 min / Interface skill level<br>
	<b>Effects :</b> personal<br>
	An aura surrounds and outlines the subjects (maximum equivalent to the Intelligence of the hacker). Outlined subjects can be tracked and do not benefit from the concealment normally provided by darkness, blur, displacement, invisibility or similar effects. The hacker can then transmit the information to other willing targets, as much as its level of Intelligence.
<h3 class="c"><a id="hack62">Target ID</a></h3>
	<b>Type :</b> Surface<br>
	<b>Difficulty :</b> 10<br>
	<b>Time :</b> 1 round full<br>
	<b>Duration :</b> 1 hour / Interface skill level<br>
	<b>Effects :</b> cyberbrains / servers / AI<br>
	Every combatant on one side can use a full round action (so only effective if some time is allowed to prepare before an encounter) to add a friend-foe signature other members of their team. This makes the target aware of your location, up to a kilometer away. It relays information of where all the members of the team are within the visual field (even if members are behind walls, several floors above or below). All involved also can target enemies easier if attempting to fire into melee combat where another member using Target ID is involved. The -4 penalty to fire into melee combat is reduced to -2. This relay is nullified if a cyberblocker is used.
<h3 class="c"><a id="hack27">Temporary Brain Damage</a></h3>
	<b>Type :</b> CyberHack<br>
	<b>Difficulty :</b> 35<br>
	<b>Time :</b> 2 actions<br>
	<b>Duration :</b> temporaire<br>
	<b>Effects :</b> cyberbrains / servers / AI<br>
	The brain struck suffers 1D4 temporary INT damage. Only a full day of rest will allow you to recover one INT point. There must be a physical connection to instigate the surge, wireless attacks cannot cause energy damage. It does not require breaking through the barrier but each barrier not broken absorbs one point of damage.
<h3 class="c"><a id="hack63">Temporary Hack Resistance</a></h3>
	<b>Type :</b> CyberHack<br>
	<b>Difficulty :</b> 20<br>
	<b>Time :</b> 2 actions<br>
	<b>Duration :</b> 1 min / Interface skill level<br>
	<b>Effects :</b> all<br>
	The target (if you plug into it) or yourself gain an additional defense barrier equal to 20 + Interface. However, you may not attempt anything other than to defend yourself, or your target, during this time.
<h3 class="c"><a id="hack64">Transmitter</a></h3>
	<b>Type :</b> Virus<br>
	<b>Difficulty :</b> 30<br>
	<b>Time :</b> 1 action<br>
	<b>Duration :</b> 1 hour / Interface skill level<br>
	<b>Effects :</b> all<br>
	The target transmits its location continuously onto the cell net. Only outside interference or autistic mode can sever this link and if time remains on the virus, it will resume if it can continue the connection. This is not like Target ID, this places a beacon forcefully on another target.</div><br>
