<p><span class="r">Overview:</span> Pierce Brosnan as 007 stars in this scifi espionage flick about a guy with a lawnmower who tries to take over the world... Well, that's not exactly it, but close :)<br><br>
This might be another one of those I'm out to lunch on, but I'm guessing most have seen this flick. Lawnmower Man was originally derived from a Stephen King novel (although considering that King sued to have his name removed, we might infer he wasn't thrilled with this movie), and is about a genius government funded scientist (Brosnan) who's doing research on increasing human intelligence through using drug-assisted virtual reality experiments. His research, originally done on chimps, was cut off when a chimp goes wild, so instead of giving up, he does the research in his basement, using the local lawnmower dullard as his test subject.<br><br>
Over time, the Lawnmower guy becomes awesomely intelligent, so much so that he grows more powerful than anyone could have possibly imagined. So much so, in fact, that he becomes a potential threat to mankind!</p>
<p><span class="r">The Bottom Line:</span> Lawnmower man is an early entree into 3D graphics. The graphics were rather decent at the time but certainly looks dated now. It's still a nice scifi thriller that fully qualifies as a cyberpunk movie in every way possible. I enjoy this, and generally like Brosnan movies, but maybe its just a guilty pleasure of mine. Whereas I find it watchable in a cheesy sort of way, I can certainly imagine others scoffing at some of the insane plot points (like going from a multi-million dollar a year funded defense project, to getting better results in your basement). But even if you find this one watchable, it's a pretty clear bet that you won't stand a chance at liking the sequel.</p></div>
