<h1>Zodiac: The Eco-Thriller</h1>
</center><br>
<div class="c">
<h3>Synopsis</h3>
<p>Zodiac is set in present time Boston, and hero Sangamon Taylor (S. T.), ironically describes his hilarious exploits in the first person. S. T. is a modern superhero, a self-proclaimed Toxic Spiderman. With stealth, spunk, and the backing of GEE (the Group of Environmental Extremists, a non-profit environmental group) as his weapons, S. T. chases down the bad guys with James Bond-like zen.</p>
<p>Cruising Boston Harbor with lab tests and scuba gear, S. T. rides in with the ecosystem cavalry on his 40-horsepower Zodiac raft. His job of tracking down poisonous runoff and embarrassing the powerful corporations who caused them becomes more sticky than usual; run-ins with a gang of satanic rock fans, a deranged geneticist, and a mysterious PCB contamination that may or may not be man-made - plus a falling-out with his competent (&quot;I adore stress&quot;) girlfriend - all complicate his mission.</p>
