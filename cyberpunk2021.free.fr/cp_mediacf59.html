<p><i>Until the End of the World</i> is a science fiction movie directed by Wim Wenders.</p>
<br>
<h3>Synopsis</h3>
<p>Set in 1999, a woman (Dommartin) has a car accident with some bank robbers, who befriend and enlist her help to take the money to a drop in Paris. On the way she runs into another fugitive from the law (Hurt), an American who is being chased by the CIA. The charges are false, he says, that they want to confiscate a device his father has invented which allows you to record your dreams and vision. On the run from the bank robbers and the CIA, they span the globe, ending up in Australia at the research facility of his father (von Sydow), where they hope to be able to play back the recordings Hurt has made to his blind mother.</p>
