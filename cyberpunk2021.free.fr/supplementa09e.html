<h2>Supplements and scenarios for Cyberpunk</h2>
			<p>This page is dedicated to supplements and reviews for Cyberpunk games. It was initially created by <b>Coredump Inc</b>.<br>
			A small note about the publishers of the Cyberpunk range. We can distinguish 4 main protagonists :</p>
			<p><b>Talsorian Games</b>, Talsorian Games, holder of the rights on the game and main publisher since having published Cyberpunk 2020. The quality of their supplement was very inconsistent at first, with a very &quot;techno fight&quot; orientation, but then gradually improved to give more developed and interesting supplements.</p>
			<p><b>Atlas Games</b>, which published an infamous series of scenarios, each one more crappy and empty than the last. The quality of their books is at best <i>mediocre</i>, and is mainly limited to the <i>bad</i>. To be avoided.</p>
			<p><b>Ianus Games</b>, now renamed Dream Pod 9, has published a very interesting series of supplements called Alternate Reality. The idea was to push the Cyberpunk context a bit further, by adding a mystical dimension (myths, religions, sects, beliefs...). Some of their supplements are squarely oriented towards the supernatural like Night's Edge and propose to include vampires, but others flirt with the ambiguity of the thing (Voodoo : does it really work ?) like Grimm's Cybertales, and this ambiguity can make the game very interesting. Moreover, the quality of their production is very good, both in content and form, which doesn't spoil anything.</p>
			<p><b>Oriflam</b> publishes the French translations for the Cyberpunk range in France. Apart from the execrable translations (the first ones were made by students barely speaking English !), the questionable publishing choices, the horrible layout, the company not only doubles the price of the supplements, but also withdraws a chapter it publishes in its own magazine. Morality, if you want your supplement in full, not content with having paid 150 Francs, you have to afford the mag'. Lamentable.</p>
