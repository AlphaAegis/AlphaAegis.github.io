<h1>Dirty Work</h1>
</center><br>
<div class="c">
<p><i>Dirty Work</i> is Pat Cadigan's third collection of short stories. It was published in 1993.</p>
<p>The stories in this collection cover many themes, but one of their unifying factors is the twist in the tail, the final ironic flick of a sleek paw that, with careless, whimsical cruelty, toys with the reader.</p>
