		<h4>Review</h4>
		<p>This is an opportunity for players to become the bodyguards of a rock star, Jack Entropy, during his tour through Europe : England, Belgium, France, Italy, Sweden, Czechoslovakia and Switzerland. A good opportunity to use your Eurosource+ supplement if you have already bought it. The scenario is interesting but the plot is often below what you would expect, and the prime goes to the action scenes. However, a diligent GM will do his best to bring the script up to par and make the most of it.</p>
