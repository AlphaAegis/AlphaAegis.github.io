		<h4>Review</h4>
		<p>I am still doubtful about the usefulness of this supplement, which claims to be inspired by Tales from the Forlorn Hope and proposes a corporation that plays the role of a temporary agency for cyberpunks (?!). In essence, we find the profile of the so-called &quot;StreetTime&quot; corporation, and the description of about thirty NPCs employed by it. Then, a series of files on some corporations using &quot;temporary staff&quot; is attached to a series of contract proposals. It's a bit like ManPower of gunslingers, and it's quite well done, even if one can wonder about the legality of mercenarism in 2020. In my opinion, this supplement can inspire a GM that wants a fixed starting base for the PCs, a kind of basic employer while keeping a certain diversity in the action. It can also lead to an &quot;A-Team&quot; atmosphere. To be reserved for those who prefer &quot;Your mission, should you decide to accept it...&quot; type scenarios, and who are looking for a starting point without the PCs always being recruited in bars.</p>
